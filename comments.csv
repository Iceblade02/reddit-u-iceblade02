The barben are driven out of the city, and the fires are extinguished. The monks were now properly greeted, and directed to the Orlo village elder. The monks recognized him as the elder that the group of men had been defending earlier. He says

Definitely, as the Aquitinians come from an entirely different part of dawn, these natives are... Lets say *different*. My thoughts where that:

 the Barben are a nomadic people, living like robbers and outlaws, harrasing Aquitinians, Orlo and Arsan alike. They consider human liver a delicacy.

The Arsan would be living in a proto agrarian way, very keen on staying isolated from the rest of the world, the few times they have been encountered they have been very kind

 and the Orlo are those who have found themselves partly integrated into the actual society, they are chiefly animal herders (animal tamers). 

This could make for quite vicious *internal conflicts* in the future,  an element that might both enhance, and cripple a civilization.",

Everyone settles down, with a cup of water, to refresh the mind.The man begins his tale:

*The Aquitinians came to this land long ago, or so they say. They say they rose out of the sea, created by their water god, Aqqas. They built great cities of wood, and deforested almost the entirety of Aquitinia, thus wood is a luxury. They have lived with us now, for 150 years, their numbers steadily growing. They also tell the tale of a sister people,[The Murtavira] far over the seas, but that tale is for a later time.*

[The finished tale is a lot longer, so time has passed]
When Hanubi finishes the tale, the sun has long since passed below the horizon. So the sailors accept the hospitality of Hanubi, and eat a dinner composed of cooked fish, roots and young Bottle Gourd.

The next morning the group once again leaves (with Hanubi) and they travel back to the stilt city, and after a bit of walking, they arrive at the house of the Aqa, one person guarding the entrance.
Hanibu says:

*Hello, wi har kommit for att besoka Aqlan, ve har viktiga besokare.*

The guard responds, and steps aside to let the group pass.

When they arrive before the Aqlad, he seems prepared for them. Hanibu translates:

*The leader may sit down, the rest can stand, for now.*

The captain sits down, and the Aqlad (apparently an important person, presumably a [leader](https://www.reddit.com/r/DawnPowers/wiki/indexclaimednations/aquitinians#wiki_government) of some kind) begins to speak.

*I bid yoa welcome to Aquitinia, my noma is Alto (Fido) Rescos and am the Aqlad of this qountry. I am very heppy to heve visitirs, but eqsactly, who are you?*

The Aquitinians choose Maritime as their primary with [The Dhow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhow) as their early boat (a more primitive version of it), they choose riggings & sails, and 

Their secondary is animal taming(sanga cattle). Their towns/villages are built at the coast, with stables (fences made of wood) for the cattle made out of stone on the mainland (the stone is not mined, it is collected from the seashore and filled in with mud and reeds, when building), and maritime buildings made out of wood on stilts above the water, there they also keep their boats, and other main buildings. 

The Aquitinians originated from a failed expedition from muravite that ended up in a storm, after a week clinging to the shipwreck the survivors ended up north of Tenebrae, with little memory of their previous lives, due to memory loss. The expedition had NOT been sanctioned by the Muravite government, thus making records of the expedition hard to find.

* **Ondo Thassos**, the man that started the travel to Aquitinia. Today he is a symbol for the Aquitinian nation.

* **Aqqo Heneo**, the founder of Aqqo, said to have built the first sections with his own hands.

Creatures

* **Aleondo**, the son of Aqas, he is responsible for all storms and all the miraculously saved sailors.

* **The Katheno**, the bloodsucking descendants of the cursed Kathen, who tried to burn down Aqqo. (vampire)

* various dangerous creatures that avoid the coast.

* ~~**Sirens**~~ **Mermaids**, they take the sailors of boats, and bring them to the bottom of the sea, to live with them, myth says they actually do. 

The Orlo are the natives who embraced civilization directly.

* **Hanno Bublo** (hero), The first Orlo to learn Aquitinian.

Since we are close to the Hegemony, but still unwilling to fully join it, our Aqlada proposed a military alliance between us, and the Hegemony.

This status Quo could be broken, either by a decisive victory on either part, resulting in great loss of life - or the addition of soldiers on either side, although the Imperium hardly has enough friends to achieve such a feat. At this day, the Tenebrae and Suparian armies are completely occupied in the north, leaving the rest of their country undefended to any reasonably large force.

Ask me if anything bothers you]

When the horde approaches the city, they see a small Aquitinian camp, by the shore, with dimly lit fires, seemingly unaware of the approaching danger. [That isn't the case] There are also a few platforms covered by sheets, in the water. Hidden with the help of darkness, and the unattentiveness of the militia, there is a small fleet slightly further offshore carrying about 50 archers (self bow, burning arrows dipped in animal fat/bronze tipped arrows, poisoned, leather armor, bronze daggers) and 50 infantry (""leatherthorax"", bronze sword drenched in poison, Aspis shields). As the militia come charging against the camp, they sense somehing is wrong, the telltale signs of activity are missing, and soon the camp falls away to reveal 400 Aquitinian soldiers (150 archers, self bow, burning arrows dipped in animal fat/bronze tipped arrows, poisoned, leather armor, bronze daggers, 150 swordmen, ""leatherthorax"", bronze sword drenched in poison, Aspis shields, and 100 spearmen, long spears bronze tip, poison, aspis shield, ""leatherthorax"", standing behind the lineof fighting ready to impale the militia occupied by the swordsmen) receiving the brunt of the spears on their raised shields, while the militia crash into concealed wooden spikes, and trenches, taking the brunt out of the assault. Soon the response came, as the sky lit up, and burning arrows started striking down into the mob, causing panic, which in turn spreads the deadly fire. Furthermore, the platforms in the water were now uncovered, sporting 25 archers each (there's two of them) releasing poison arrows, to accompany the burning ones. As the two armies started to lock into combat, 100 swordsmen (same equipment) crashed into the back of the assaulting army, mowing down the militia, and continuing forward (there'll probably be a little time before people realize whats going on), and soon after, 50 swordsmen rushed in from the shore, assaulting the flank of the army.

As the Imperialist armies marched south, they ventured into untamed lands, where mobile groups of hunters lived off the land, without anything to loot. However, their march triggered an assembly of hunter groups, who soon got to know that this force of invasion was pillaging and burning, only to kill. Many volunteered to defend their country, and others were persuaded by promises of compensation after the war. These hunters soon began leading the Union army on a course to intercept the invaders.

The union army:

- Aquitinian troops ~1100 soldiers

- Zefarri troops

- Local hunters ~1000 (self bow/spear, experienced users, no/little armor)

The answer soon came, these people were carrying the same disease first brought by the Tao. As the numbers increased, a large scanning commensed. Noone sick was allowed to enter, they were sent back, whence they came, and those who did enter, had to pay a minor fee, to pay for their new lodgings in the west. A similar system that handled the cities arose in these new settlements, those sick, were either banished, or kept away from the healthy, in hopes to hold back the plague.

> Other early samples of iron may have been produced by accidental introduction of iron ore in bronze smelting operations. Iron appears to have been smelted in the West as early as 3000 BC, but bronze smiths, not being familiar with iron, did not put it to use until much later. In the West, iron began to be used around 1200 BC.

I was thinking of this as a way to introduce iron slowly, over a couple of hundred years, leading way for more RP.

Since the Aquitinians are slightly familiar with iron, and the concept is already around, I saw no reason for them *not* using it, but only in very small scale.

These would simply rob ships of their goods, but some of the more lowly sailors of these ships would join the settlement. 900 BCE, a large wave of fleeing people arrived from the collapsing/collapsed mandar, these were merchants, farmers and civilians. During this period, a group of Murtaviran bureaucrats arrived, to help govern the now sprawling city. 
 
900-800 BCE: During this period, the city grows a lot, gaining a lot of ground, and the beginnings of a village can be found in the western bay on the island. Many of the slaves taken by the first settlers are now free people, though their descendants are still in slavery, working to buy their freedom. New trade with the coastal countries of dawn boosts the economy, and helps bring goods (ex. metal) that can't be found on the Island.

800-750: The raiders begin their gruesome work, but this also brings many new citizens to the country (those who buy their freedom), grow the crews (those who are wanted), and bring in money (sold as slaves). A population of nearly 200,000 in the beginning of the century soon grows, when new soil is claimed, and farmed. A proper infrastructure is now growing around Gur Tzi, with roads, wells, reservoirs.... Gur Tzi has also become a major trading market, hosting the newly formed government of Aden (thats what I'll call the country), and being the spot where the ships of the Enli come, from all over the world, pirates, and traders.

By the 750's, the little village on the western coast had grown, and the mark of the Enli could be seen by all, that weren't blind. This is when the now settled government decided to make their presence known to the world, and stake their claim, on the surrounding lands, and in time, the entire Island of Ihai (Bakku).",

It soon became clear that the Enli called their Island not Bakku, but Ihai. The way of life in Aden soon became clear. Slaves were brought there, given the option to buy their freedom, and stay on the Island, or, if they had certain desired traits, join the crews of the ships. Otherwise they would be sold as slaves, most often to foreigners.

The first slaves, the ones that had served the Enli, before they forbade slavery would live as slaves, until the age of 35, when they would be emancipated and given a lump sum to start their new life. However, any children born in slavery would have to go through the same process before freedom (they could however be bought by their parents). However, when the question of where the city of Gur Tzi was, the Ashad met a stone wall.

That question, it was said, was a very expensive one, one that no individual person could afford to pay. There were of course rumors of the location, but noone outside Aden knew the precise location, and it seemed that it would stay that way, a long time.

To most, the way the enli lived was very alike to that of the Tao, but the keener noticed a great difference. The sea was a crucial part in the life of every person, and nearly every man, and woman had made at least one longer voyage by sea. The enli had also gone to great lenghts to predict the ""mood"" of the sea, many could see, or feel that rain was coming, or that a storm was brewing.

One thing that puzzled the Ashad was the fact that very few goods where produced in Aden, however, the few merchants that arrived always had a great variety of goods with them. Small shops, with specialized products made from goods brought by the ships could be found in the harbours. Rattan furniture was one of them.",

Pullies and cranes had become a great help, and was Gur Tzi was clawing at the sky. Architects were funneling heaps of coin into wondrous projects, amongst them, a large lighthouse to signal faraway ships.

Pullies were... Annoying at times, their ropes would break, and they were surprisingly limited in their capabilities. This became very apparent in more permanent structures, also, pullies were of little use when working horizontally. Here new machinery had to be developed, to open larger doors, and turn big cranes. Wheels had long been used, but they were of little use within mechanics, however, many noticed the fact that they fitted perfectly together (if they were the same size). The problem was, that they gave no traction, no power was transferred between the wheels. Some solved this by making cuts into the wood, and thus fitting the wheels together, so that one wheel would spin the other. 

This small miracle became known as **gears**, however, we do not know how much credit should be given to the inventor, rumors are, he stole the idea from someone else.",

As time wears on, the Advisors are accepted as observers in the council, even allowed to voice their opinions and arguments. They are however ushered outside by guards at times, when more sensitive matters are discussed.

In the larger towns these devices were mounted in large scale where some parts are replaced with wood. The cauldron is replaced with a wooden watersealed container where hot stones are dropped into it through a chute, which is then closed, causing the water to boil, and evaporate into a wooden cone, with a thin metal sheet on the inside and outside, with a leather covered wooden dish above. Then there is the half tube (wooden) leading to a small reservoir, from where it is pumped into a larger one. These distilleries are pretty large, and the process is halted a times, to empty the stones (hatch which can be opened in the side to empty the water and stones, salt water is pumped in from the sea at regular intervals). The water is then rationed to everyone (small base ration), and extra water can be bought.

The work given to people is mostly:

* Chopping wood, and acquiring fuel for fires (dry grass etc.) this also prevents fires around the cities.

* Fishing, and getting seaweed and other seafood, crewing ships.

* Building ships, roads, infrastructure (Aqueducts)

* Misc jobs, transporting water, cleaning etc.

Many of these jobs are funded by the government, who previously has had very few expenses, and money from the treasuries is funneled into jobs. (often in the form of coupons for food, water and other essentials) If the money runs out, money is lended from rich merchants, with the promise of repayment.

An expedition to the east is also funded (upcoming exp post).

The fishing industry is booming, the ports bustling, producing the majority of the food for the nation, large ships are coming to and fro, leaving tonnes of fish and seafood for the hungry. Many live along the shores in rudimentary homes, living on government funds, hoping to return to their abandoned homes, someday...

There is a governor in every city (if this expansion is approved, there are 3), and a small group of bureaucrats.

In every city there is a justice system, with a couple of professional soldiers to keep the calm, and cage any criminals (privateers and slavers excluded). The most common punishment for crimes is a small period of slavery.



The council is made up of different categories, there are 15 total, two of the spots are hereditary, 4 are bought by the merchants, and 4 are chosen by the people, 2 scholars, 2 chosen by the exiting council members and 1 for the military.

When the elders failed to respond, they were at first chasticed, one man losing his little finger in a gruesome way. However, they soon realized that the elders in fact didn't speak ashadi, and the wounds of the man were tended, and he was left in the village, as a sign of mercy, three of the other elders were taken, to be transported to ashadi lands.

Even though the captives were in bondage, they were treated kindly, given sufficient food, and allowed some hygiene (such as a pot twice a day, and some seawater to wash with). Slavery was a profession, but even slavers had compassion and treated them with some respect.

It was common among the higher ranking sailors to choose wives among the more beautiful captives. A successful sailor could have as many as seven women back in the port, though a number twenty had seen, once or twice in during the times of slaving. These women would be provided for by their husbands at sea. 

In the some of the trading cities the ratio of women to men had been as bad as 8/1 during the golden age of slavery. Nowadays, the number was smaller, only 7/2.

But, it was custom to give the woman a choice, slavery or the relative freedom of being the wife of a sailor. During the travel home it was soon decided which women would have which men, and these were often introduced to each other quite early, and allowed to make each others acquaintance. It was a custom to treat the women well, as they were oft already considered a part of the society. Once they arrived in the port, someone knowing the ongin language would help the women make their choice, only the fools chose slavery, as it was widely known, even told to the women that wivery  (lack of better word) was a kinder fate.

Some of the fitting men, (if they cooperated) would also be chosen to join the crew, and in time, they became fully integrated members of the crew. [This often leads to changes in culture, and language, but also the spread of knowledge, which was also helped by the foreign wives] In some cases, very rich men, or those who could help in desired ways could buy their freedom (thus the reason they were allowed to keep their money), but those who could not, would see their money lost.

After a long voyage, the twenty ships came back, heavily loaded with slaves, wives, and money, soon anchoring in the harbour. As the ships arrived, the local lord would once again hear that his presence was needed. Soon the selling of slaves, and questioning of elders would begin. /u/Pinko_Eric

---

This was but the first of many raids to come, the thrice price of slaves made the voyage lucrative, and other slavers soon joined the fray. It would however soon become clear to the Ongin, that these were men of profession, and that they avoided bloodshed when possible. There even came word of kind treatment from those few who managed to return from the south. (Yes, some more honourable merchants would ship them back if they payed good money, this also led to some trade, cuz not all of the ""evil people"" were that ""evil"")

However, as the resistance to the slavers became strong, their methods grew bolder, and crueller. As the captain of a fleet was executed, the Ongin would find a village razed, with the remaining inhabitants slaughtered, and nailed to crosses.",

The exploration, and search for water continues along the shore (since it is less risky, and water often flows down to the sea.).

The colonists attempt to make the most of their little stream, building a watertight container (pretty large ~1.5m across, 1m high, round) and divert the stream to run through it resulting in water being stored for future use.

Soon, resistance is quenched, and the soldiers begin rounding up the villagers (they are told to bring their valuables, or die) in the square. Those who see them, see suits of studded leather armor, with helms and covered faces, as well as a black aspis shield, and a sword (some wield bows).

This would be really important in a nation with bad economy, since ""good enough"" is better than ""nothing at all"".

Also worth noting would be the fact that iron can't be a secret in some societies, especially the ones that have had it for a long time.

Also, is gold working a separate tech? Especially since the earliest gold artifacts found are [dated to 4200 BCE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_Necropolis).",

Since the dawn of the old Aquitinian nation we have lived among foreigners, Always strangers in our neighborhood. Yet we learned to live with them, even the strangest of foreigners have found our lands, and people welcoming.

Accepted culture threshold -20%

Tolerance of heretics & heathens +0.5

**Brothers in Arms**

As Aquitinia collapsed, we fought to survive, yet failed. Yet we learned from our troubles, and our experience in bargaining with both friends and enemies have made us formidable soldiers of the pen.

+1 diplomatic reputation

**Years of Piracy**

As we sailed the seas, and lived on the fruits of our navies, we learned the intricacies of them and became one with our ships.

Diplomatic research cost -10%

**The Great Exodus**

As we once again were forced to leave our homelands, and build anew, we learned the important lessons of rebuilding, and repopulating.

Development Cost -10%

**The Merchants of Gur Tzi**

During the years after the exodus, we relied greatly on our trade for the building of our new nation. From these years of trading we learned much about trade.

Trade efficiency +5%

Trade income +5%

**Spreading our way of thought**

During the years of trade many of the richer merchants spread their power into foreign countries, bringing with them our way of thought.

Spy network construction +10%

**The Navy Forests**

Over the centuries we deforested our Island with the goal of building boats. This led to a new law. Every major city had to have their own planted forest - to supply wood for ships.

Naval Force Limit +10%

**The Land of the Free**

Over the centuries, our people became used to our democratic methods, and our way of life. In the end this would come to the benefit of the nation, as the people created our government.

**Enli Ambitions**

As a foundation to their success was always their curiosity. When the Enli looked off their shores they saw not a cruel world, but empty shores ripe for the taking.

The pros are that it is a fairly lively world with things happening constantly, and oppurtunities for players to do missions.

Another example is Russia, viking age, where feudalism started pushing out hunter-gatherer societies and the land farmed.

The Enli fleet of 200 left Anod before the war even started. They headed west, collecting men and soldiers. When they passed by Gur Tzi, a simple message was left in the harbour: ""You're free to take their ships.""

The fleet halted in Poden, only slightly north of the border. As the war began, they sailed south, and then east, towards the city of Al-Bakku.

---

**One week earlier: The calling of the Banners**

Riders rode out to every corner of the nation, calling peasants, soldiers and lords to war. Reports had come of tens of thousands of foreigners massing in al-bakku, preparing an attack.

The fortresses were manned, garrisons strengthened, supplies gathered. A great camp grew outside of Al-Kapor, it was a city all by itself, bustling with soldiers, its inhabitants counted in the thousands growing as bands of soldiers and recruits came all directions.

---

*In a random fortress somewhere along the border*

""Men! I am your commander, and War is coming. We have food in the cellars enough for the whole hundred for three months, and straw for the horses lasting half a year.""

The parchment with the fortresses inventory was produced.

* 20 Professional soldiers

* 30 Semi-Professionals

* 50 Militia

* 50 Horses

...


---
As the Al-Bakku army marched toward Al-Kapor, they encountered two of these fortresses, these were seen from far-away and would not give any details, unless scouts were sent.

The fleet continuously headed north, taking three villages, and a smaller town. When they arrived at their first larger city, its governor surrendered as well, on behalf of the city. At the coast could be seen a fort no flag flying. Strangely, none of the city watch, or garrison could be found. They found the gates of the castle locked tight.

He did however not know when his brother would strike, and so, he had begun to prepare the realm for war. Several key cities in the realm had been fortified with walls, while major ports had smaller ones, combined with moats. He had also tasked several of the borderloards with building several small, highly fortified strongholds along the border.

It was also widely ""known"" that Nidhan was the evil brother of Baladhor. That he with his honeyed tongue and deceptive plots had taken himself to the top of the Andai, to take the Island for himself.

Following this, Baladhor had begun the training of an elite cavalry squad, and decreed the following:

* Every village should provide one fully armed and trained soldier, for every fifty living in the village.

* Every man (or woman) that went through a one week training, and returned once every year for training sessions would receive 5 coppers on a yearly basis.

* Every lord (large or small) should provide at least armed and mounted horsemen, as well as 30 footmen.

This would mean that he would have an army at the snap of his fingers, trained and ready, for when needed.

Addam had had his fair share of dancing through the years, and unlike many other men of his age, he had stayed fit, escaping most of the ailments of age. 

He started slowly, making sure that Sheia knew the dance, before speeding up. The dancing awakened something inside him that he hadn't felt in years. It made him remember his other marriage, her scent. That led him onwards, the love, the agony. Oh the sorrow, it hit him like a wave. He suppressed the thoughts, but not before a lone tear had begun rolling down his cheek. He opened his eyes and saw Sheia. He wouldn't let it happen again, he would not. 

He returned to the current. The dance, the music, the woman. His new wife. He looked into her eyes and smiled. 

His eyes still showed the sorrow within. He had pushed it away for far too long, it was time to face it once and for all, it was time to move on.

They danced on, and on, and the evening was beginning to draw to a close, with the music becoming calmer and the dance slowing down. Somewhere along the line, Arlan came, fairly tired.

""Goodnight Arlan"", Addam gave him a smile

""Goodnight grandpa""

""If you want something before bed, ask Elaena, okay?""

""I will"" Arlan smiled tiredly and walked off.

Soon after, Addam took a small tour around the hall, Sheia in tow saying goodnights and goodlucks for the upcoming events. 

Then, they left the hall and headed up to Addams chambers. As they entered Sheia was met by a pleasantly warm room with a big hearth and a bed with the finest of sheets. There was a small, round table with a fresh, red apple and a set of glasses and a shiny bottle of white wine accompanied by a set of comfortable chairs and a larger sofa. The floor had several comfortable-looking carpets laid out, so as to avoid a cold floor.

Addam walked over to the table, and took a seat, beckoning her to do the same. The air was fresh, tinged with a smell of roses. Addams eyes were kind, and slightly tired.

As he waited, he opened the bottle and poured a little to both of them. He took a sip. It tasted richly, the apples being from one of the longest summers through all of history. Most would pay a fortune for one of these bottles, but luckily for him, there were fifteen bottles still in the wine cellar. Lucky him.

He returned it, and as she stroked his back, those lips wandered further, and further down her body. A tingling sensation spread as her nipples stiffened, but Addam moved further down, leaving warm, wet marks behind. He kissed her on her lower lips, and kissed, and kissed....

No. 3 The first two techs you get should be Experimentation (it gives research points at the end of every cycle) and banking (bonus money, useful for kickstarting your empire).

No.4 Don't be the one to attack. The defender gets a (+1) bonus to damage. Wait for extra tech. Also, make sure to have some ships stationed at your borders, it gives a large advantage. (particularly in the beginning)

No. 5 Later in the game consider building some stars up with extra industry, they kind of protect themselves. (But also consider the costs)

Sure, it is convenient, but does not give any detail. The star tab however, gives too much detail and very little oversight. Therefore, the galaxy tab is most convenient, you can easily see the cheapest alternative, but also have the map available to cross-check, so you don't upgrade a doomed star.

2 - Especially on your first game (noob game) there is unlikely to be rushes, since players still haven't gotten into their shoes yet. But, there is a limit to everything.

5 - This is probably on the geolocation bit, and also coupled to no. 1, don't trust anything blindly. Of course the costs increase, but if you don't have any really cheap stars, consider taking a more expensive one, sometimes it's worth it. Protecting five stars is much easier than ten.

One could do glorious things with it, they had even detailed the little trees of New Barrels orchards. He said that they should do the same with the Ashford castle some day.

It soon turned out that the whole group was a bit tired from the fun and games, it was time to move on, it was something that they all felt. A tap of ice fell from a nearby tree as the party assembled. It was cold Arlan noted, very so.

Addam had a grim look on his face as he walked through the battlefield. He had been part of many a battle, and he definitely wasn't green anymore. Regardless of what his crest might
suggest. He had much skill with arms - but he was growing old. His muscles were aching after the fight, his arms tired after the sword and shield had grown heavy, and his legs exhausted. 

Despite that, he looked over the battlefield, to find those wounded and dead who couldn't make it back to camp alone. Thus he saw the trio, and made for them. ""Hello?"" .... ""Are you all right?""

He quickly saw that was not the case, Oswin was hanging limp as Othello tried to lift him. ""He was wounded during the battle. Adanac just came"" He gestured toward the man.

Arlan greeted Olgierd as well, and agreed with Edmund. ""Indeed we will"" he smiled. He was quite happy, the Ashfords had that effect on him.

As they left outside, he started chatting with Edmund about nights they had camped outside, their times around the campfire. He was quite fond of those. He also invited Amy to listen in, so she would not feel lonely.

Meanwhile Arlan righted himself once more, after nearly falling off his horse. So, the fight had begun, white fluffy cold flying through the air, laughter ringing in their ears.

Arlan became the target of his brother, pelting him over and over. It soon became clear that the two boys had distinctly different riding patterns, Arlan favoring a moderate pace, where Frost could manuever nimbly through the winter land. Othello on the other hand preferred riding straight, fast, much like a knight would handle his horse in a joust. 

Othello on the other hand had a better throw, his balls shooting far ahead, or to the side and striking his unsuspecting ""victim"". Arlan would arrive from an unexpected angle, a ball in each of his hands and pepper the target. 

But, as it turns out in every snowball fight, the adults are common targets, while the youngsters ended up in two teams, Oswin together with Othello, and both the younger brothers helping each other out.",

He had stayed with Oswin most of the time, and had given him the small cares that no one else had time to give during the trip. He had washed himself,  and donned some of the few clothes he had that were not shredded, bloody or muddy. 

He had combed his black hair to the side, and his brown eyes were tired. He had a yellow and green tunic on top. ""Indeed it does"", he replied, voice both solemn and tired. ""It seems they took good care of you, eh?"", he failed to mention the fact that they had yet to show him a room to leave his belongings. There were some things that a child out of wedlock could never escape. The baseborn are always a lower priority than those of true blood. He had barely had any experience of this, until Arlan of course. 

When Ceryse had returned to New Barrel with her little child, she had almost instantly recaptured the attention of both Addam and Reynald. The heir needed care, and he got it. The coming of Sheia had not done anything to improve his situation. In his mind, it was a good thing that they had come to Ashford, not only for training and the company of others, but also because New Barrel was becoming less welcoming, especially with Sheia's new children. He had pondered a while why they had allowed his younger brother to go to the citadel, he had been far too young. In his mind, it was not because he wanted to go, but because it was a convenient way to get rid of him.

As the party left the village, and started to ""enjoy their prizes"" those who had fled now returned to the village, distraught over its fate. Those men who had been out on longer trips made sure to put out all the fires, which was quite easy considering the proximity to water. The village would be rebuilt, but a new addition came. Something that had only ever been seen around the larger villages. Any raiders who returned in the coming months would find that a palisade had been erected around the village, and the trend spread with the word of the deadly raid.

None of the few women who survived the actual battle were happy with their treatment, and those who could properly be enjoyed and did not die from their wounds before, or soon after resisted mightily. Most of those women who had stayed in the village had had children, the others would have been out with the other fishers. The children were dead.

As the morn approached, in an act of final revenge, two of the women slit the throats of the men who had used them, as they slept, and went out into the camp. Moments later the tents of the raiders were a blazing inferno and those of the captives who could run had done so.",

Those few who - foolishly tried to chop the houses down, quickly ended up dead [we can disregard this, noone even tried].

The Ainúri fought hard from their positions, protecting their homes, and their children. While the archers might not have reached the slingers, they were a constant threat to the close combat assailants. The stones felled the occacional man or woman. But the fire - it was worse. When buildings caught on fire, they burned hot. This, however only made the villagers fight harder, surrounded, cornered and in terror, the adrenaline burst through their veins.

Closer to the river, some of those adults who did not partake in the fight were ushering their children into the boats, taking them out onto the river, out to safety.

The fight raged on, many died on both sides, most, in fact of the villagers who stayed behind did not make it, yet they fought hard, and most of those ninety raiders who came followed them into their graves. The brave die, the cowardly survive, that is the way of the world.

Anything I say you ignore, simply overriding it. Just *stop*.

As I have said previously, they would by fighting from the height advantage of the gangplanks that surround the houses, not from inside. ""Fleeing"" from the house would be as simple as just jumping down.

Also, reaching someone to knock them out when they world a spear, and you a club is *hard*.

The kids would be huddled inside the houses that you so ungraciously burned up, or a few on the other side of the river. Thus, most would be *dead*.

Those houses aren't an exact replica of what would be there, yet as I said - they burned. 

As you started doing, I made assumptions. I assumed that at least some of the men who ""enjoyed"" their captives fell asleep shortly afterwards, this happens fairly often. Then I made the assumption that some of the women were very angry, and did not fall asleep, and that *two* women managed to wriggle themselves out of their bonds, as they were alone with a sleeping man in the tent.

And, I see no reason why they would be so quick to discover the escapees, ""There were a few wary eyes watching over the loot and herds"" and the rest partied and enjoyed their prizes. So ""A few"" of roughly 40 men, some injured. That would be about five. They were watching the little loot they got, and the heads, not the camp. In the early morning (Just as the light of the sun below the horizon begins to show) the most people would be asleep, and since ""the rest"" had been partying, they would be *very asleep*, allowing the two women to cut the bonds of their fellow captives, and then run away. Also, the sentries would be quite tired as well at this hour.

Now, the camp would not have been made close to the burned village, since the smell and smoke would be bad, and I see no reason for them to return there since what few items were of value had been ransacked.  

Now, I could claim that a whole lot of people had been out fishing and killed all you people, but no. ]

All right, big unhappy rant finished.


Those who had returned had slept well, and were in the full of their senses, unlike the few fighters who had been roused in the early morn and followed the women. They were quickly knocked out by the group of villagers present, who did not return until it was very obvious that the raiders had left the area.

As the Ainúri began to make an ever larger number of masks, they wanted to customize them even further. An obvious way to do this was to colour them. Thus, some ventured into the forests, and started to find many different plants and small critters. After some time of grinding berries, plants and bugs they ended up with a few **Simple Dyes**.

As for the **tournettes**, they would be using the RP initially intended for the pottery wheels, as I havs understood from reading a bit about them - they are basically the same but more primitive. 

In the beginning - there was pinch pottery, it produced simple pots that could hold simple things. These pots were made and used a long time, by many different people. After several hundreds of years of this, a young potter had an idea. He used to rotate his pots while shaping them, but he had a problem. He always used one hand to rotate, and one to shape. This was troublesome for him, as he felt it could be done more efficiently. So, he started to ponder the problem. He thought on this, many days, and many nights, until he finally came up with a solution. If he could rotate the pot with his feet - he could use both hands for shaping. Doing so however, he would break the pot with his clumsy feet. So, instead he placed it on a round piece of wood, drove a wooden peg through it and made a hole for the peg in the ground. Then, he tried out his new solution. It worked! Unwittingly, he had created one of the first **tournettes**.",

If they don't want an agreement - or a larger alliance, we need not discuss the details. As such, my very first question is: Is this"" he was now speaking to all three of the lords ""something you are interested in?""

He made a pause before continuing. ""I will let you think while I satisfy my nephew with some much wanted details"" Addam smiled.

""The objective of such a political union would be to unite... *us*, the smaller lords, and give us a voice within the Reach. What we want to achieve? Well, that is up for discussion, I for one would first of all be happy to be compensated for the great costs of the war - or at least more lenient taxes for a while to let the Reach rebuild and regrow itself.""

""You ask very many questions at once, my friend. The inner workings of such an endevour will be conple. I think that should be discussed. I have some ideas on it, but there is no way that a single man could work out the whole system - just to propose the damned thing.""

""I think an alliance implies that we defend each other, does it not?  Yes, the political union would use those houses it assembled to put forth their wishes, and finally there are many things in the world that need fixing.""

And yet again, Addam sighed. ""I will end, as I began. I have the skeleton of the structure worked out, but the details - they need to be discussed, thought out and about. I can not do this entirely on my own, I will need your input.""",

Addam felt slightly awkward, out of place. But a few years ago there would have been three other men like himself sitting around that table, old and grey. He had been lucky to survive, and a twinge of sadness came to his heart when he thought about it. Not only did it remind him of the death of so many, but also that death would come knocking upon his own door within time. 

Addam gave a sigh, and began to talk ""Well, I have asked for us to meet here today for a reason."" He paused, and his eyes met with those of Osmund before continuing. ""Much has changed in the last decade, much has happened. Some have grown into their lordships"" he paused, ""while others, like myself have grown old."" He let his eyes wander over the wrinkles that had formed on his hands. He remembered them younger, leaner. ""The Reach has changed - we *won* the *war*"" he smiled slightly, ""but we lost as well"" his gaze wandered from [Grance](/u/gloude) on his left, to [Jon](/u/ball3194) at his right. 

""Our realm, the Reach, is in turmoil. Peace has come, arms have been lowered but still is there a tension that is hard not to notice. I have heard rumors of the NERDs, and it is a result of the fear from the turmoil. Yet while we small lords cower in our halls, acting oblivious to the fact that a silent war is raging about us, the major players plot, plan and strategize."" Addam paused and let the others catch up to what he was saying.

""Therefore, I suggest an alliance. No, not an alliance - more than that, a political union of sorts. At first, it will just be us few, but if we give it the means to, it will grow. For too long have the small lords been ignored, trampled and overshadowed by larger houses. We are many, while they are few. If we come together, we might not rule, but at the very least we could choose who rules us, and how they rule us.""",

Countless raids during the previous *thousand years* or so had made the Ainúri wary, the militia experienced.

Runners went from these watchcamps, the fires of alarm lit. Thus alerted the villages, who in turn spread the word to their surrounding areas. Earlier, some villages had come together to defend against larger threats, but this was the first time in history that they united, as what [some](/u/SandraSandraSandra) might call a state. One man stepped forwards, from amongst all the others, he was chosen. He cast the old away and named himself Fera'llae of the Maern'einur. 

The first little hold that the Gedokosza encountered was merely a small house, not even bricked. The poor young man burned inside and the few cattle he had bought for himself  scattered into the forests. No wife had he, for he had wished to build up his house first. The poor young man.

Nevertheless, Kigeu's band marched on, and a few days later they enciuntered a large field, and the house of a rich farmer. He had heard of the oncoming storm and had sent away his children and wife together with his Cattle. He and a couple of his older sons workers were just emptying the last of the granaries when the enemy fell upon them. They plundered and took the quarter that they wanted and then left the farmer, sad but alive. The third home they arrived to was a small bricked cottage, yet completely desolate. Its occupants had heard of the approaching enemy. Packed up and left. 

When Kigeu arrived to his first village, it was surrounded by a stout palisade and closed with big, rough wooden gates. Outside the fields stretched far and wide and the village itself was quite large. Smoke rising from  a beehive kiln inside. Any raiders that would approach were met with hails of arrows and stones from over the walls, while a couple of small watchtowers inside the walls reported on the positions of the enemy.

Most of the other groups had similar encounters and *all* - even the smallest of villages - had palisades. Meanwhile, Fera'llae had sent out word for many of the militia in the villages south of the river to assemble in Loth'al, the largest town south of the river. He even called for help from north of it and got some from there.

'twas the largest army that the Ainúri had seen since the beginning of time. The time had come, there was nothing else to do but to face the enemy.

Lord Addam stood white-faced with shock as Triston approached, his mind flashing back ten whole years to when his son took the same tumble from a horse, only to be buried in the solid ground a mere ten days later. 

>The sorrow, the pain. Raynalds cold, blank face, Arlan crying as the septon took him. The eyes of the children - Othello and Aemund - as they understood the fact that they would never, ever talk to their father again. The old man who had said. I know it must be painful, but sometimes they give, and sometimes they take. It is something we all live with, something we all have to live with.

""Of course, of course we will..."" he murmured. A tear started to roll down the wrinkled and pale cheek of an old, tired man. It rolled on, and fell over the cliff, tumbled and tumbled for what seemed like ages.

A splash - as it hit the wooden flooring.

Addam returned to the world, seeing Triston before him, Othello gone, as if nothing had happened. A look of confusion reached his face ""Did you say something?"" A moment went by, in silence. Then it hit him - like a wave. He slowly sat down again, and buried his face in his hands.",

He had listened intently to what Jon said, and sucked it all into his mind. 

""So, on the matter of the Shepherd - the decision depends on the situation and the knowledge at hand. If the shepherd did destroy the crops, have him harvest all the wool from his sheep, and give it to the farmer, thus giving him the means to compensate for the lost harvest. If neither is known to have wronged the other, the farmer is simply given enough grain to make it to the next harvest.""

Then Arlan scratched his chin. ""However, if it is known that the farmer accused the shepherd out of ill will, he should be punished... Not only is he not compensated for his loss, but he is also forced to work a week every month for the Lord for one year. Without pay, of course.""

He paused. ""How does that sound?""

""I told him to skip the joust, but no, he had to just. He had to show that he was a proper knight to the fair lady Falia.""

""And now"" at this point, Addam was nigh screaming at his fellow lord, ""you tell me that he isn't *worth* her hand?""

Jaena held the baby... It looked so sweet, its large eyes looking up into her own. She smiled and cuddled the baby, tickling its little hands. ""Awww, it's so cute! What's its name?""

Addam had to admit - Lydia possessed a certain beauty, neatly packaged in her small frame. The color of her lips was sweet. Yet he had Sheia, she had another kind of beauty, her hazel hair falling down to her waist, her firm, perfect breasts giving her body an admirable shape. But the smile, it surprised him every time how it made her face shine. Part of the reason for that was that she seldom smiled. Through the years, he had slowly cracked through her hard outer shell, and reached the soft and kind interior. 

He turned his gaze to Jaena, she looked very much like her mother, but was so very different. She was always the center of attention amongst her friends. His daughter had a certain way with people, she was his one and only daughter, and in a way that had made her his favorite among the three kids.

As He hadn't really thought much of the young Lady at first, but her smile really caught him off guard. As their beautiful green eyes met each other, he cheeks grew slightly flushed, as he cautiously asked - ""Are you...""

Most escaped the invaders, travelling by quick paths known only by the locals and used to their surroundings.

Ainúri runners and scouts were easily able to track the Gedokosza Hordes, as they when they moved could scarsely cover the tracks of large camps and lumbering herds of domesticated animals. Once the tracks had been found, it was nigh impossible to get rid of the scouts, who trailed these enemies at great distance, and used not fires but salted meat, fish and bread, along with the roots and legumes of the environment.

The second harvest for that year was lost. A great evil, that in a strange way helped the Ainúri. Instead of harvesting from the said fields, the adults were now free to take up arms and defend their homes instead. The rivers, streams and the sea provided plenty of food, and the granaries were able to make their diet varied.

As the narrator had previously stated, *every* respectable settlement had a palisade. Some had learned the hard way, through the previous *thousand* years of raids that one was required if the settlement were to survive.

It was not so simple to ""Simply not allow"" the militia to unite. They had first-hand knowledge of their surroundings, and knew the quickest, safest ways to go where they wished. At first, the small groups of militia were highly mobile, making them incredibly elusive to the Gedokosza. The wildfires also quickly went out when the autumn rains began to show, not to mention that they were easily visible from afar. Then, as they formed larger groups, it was simply deadly to attack them. 

Those larger groups of soldiers also gained more structure, which agriculture and fishing had given them much experience of. While their discipline and organisation were nowhere near those of the lockstep legions of Rome, they had much semblance to cohesive units - commanded by a more experienced man of the militia.

Militia does not necessarily mean weak, inexperienced, undiciplined or unorganized. Merely trained by own initiative and not by a governing force, highly motivated to defend their homes and their lands from raiding, reaving and killing invaders.

When the militia were attacked, they retaliated with swift blows from spears and daggers, bows and slings and small suckles used in short range. They parried the enemy blows deftly, using their strong shields to block the weapons of the enemy.

The Ainúri were not stupid. They had not left the palisades unmanned, and if there were lack of proper militia to hand spears to, the inhabitants of the villages gladly took them to defend their homes. When the gedokosza came first with the large amounts of fuel needed to light the palisades, and then either tried to start fire on-spot (a very hard process at the time) or with torches (incredibly visible) to the walls were quickly killed with arrows from those manning the palisades.

Meanwhile, Fera'llae had assembled his army, numbering nearly xxx. He then marched from that town in force. Any raiding parties that they encountered would die a quick, painful death.

One day, a scout returned to the command post in a rush

""We've found an enemy army, they number as many as six hundreds.""

Moments later, Fera'llae was speaking to his troops as they were arming up for battle.

""This day will go down in history"" his voice traveled over the crowd. ""Today, the evil southerners will learn that none attack us, without paying the price. We will not be killed, we will not be raided, we will not be subjugated!""

The crowd roared its assent as he finished the speech, and the army divided into their groups. The army divided into groups, corresponding to each village or town that they came from, and soon the enemy was in sight.

Arlan gave a little bow as he entered the solar, and met Jons eyes as well. When Jons eyes lit up, Arlan felt a bit happy inside. He had not only been squiring for him, but after their chat at Dunstonbury, they had occasionally had discussions of a more intellectual character. As Arlan took his seat, he replied to Jons question. ""Things have indeed been quite well, ever since Othello saw again, and he's even better now, life has been a lot more bright and colorful.""

As Jon mentioned the letter, Arlan perked up a little. But at the mention of ""Mother"" he thought at first, 'Why would Sheia...', but as he read the letter, it became clear to him. His face had lost its smile, and grown a little darker. ""How can she come back now and call herself 'Mother'..."" His voice was a mix of sorrow, anger, and spite. ""She was supposed to come back, to visit, bur then she just ran off and married to that Marq..."" Yet a little voice in his mind spoke to him, a voice that had come from his long discussions with both his father, and the man across the table. *She is not merely your 'Mother', she is a Hightower, she symbolises an alliance...*

Arlans face was still dark, but his tone was calmer as he said: ""I have no love for her, she *left* me, I've had another mother, another family that I love. Yet I think it was not Ceryse that asked for us to meet, I think Addam may think back to the fact that I have Hightower ancestry, something that can be incredibly useful, something that symbolises an alliance, even if it is long forgotten. Do you think I should go?"" He gave Jon a sincere look, the question was meant to stay between them, but he felt that he needed the advice.

*Lord* Addam started with addressing the doubts of Lord [Melvan](/u/razor1231) Lord Redwyne. ""Lord Melvan, I assure you, the funds for this project are easily provided, we are Lords in the wealthy Reach after all. Jokes aside, New Barrel will provide the bulk of the required funds."" *Lord* Addam paused a moment before continuing. ""On the subject of maintenance, the port will be mostly for economic purposes, housing no more than a few cogs. We do after all have the mighty fleet of the Shield Islands protecting us."" Addam gave Melvan a smile as he moved on to Lord Redwyne. ""As I said, the port would mostly be for economic purposes, but I think we would be able to raise roughly two thousand sailors, at the least. Since the port would not host a particularly large amount of ships, I do see your point. Fossoway sailors crewing Arbor vessels. That is something which could be discussed.""

[On sailor numbers, I used Blackcrown, I assumed sailors are based on port level and levies. Blackcrown has a T1 port, same as I would have. It has 2'000 soldiers, whereas New Barrel has 3'500 which would lead me to believe that it should have somewhat less than double the sailor amount, thus roughly 3k.]

""Anyhow, if any of you two feel like assisting with a few hundred dragons, it would be greatly appreciated. We might even be able to arrange you hiring Fossoway sailors once the port is finished.""

Addam twiddled his beard a little before finishing, ""Is there anything else I should think of before building the port?""

His gaze passed over his grandfather, Lord Addam and the rest of his family, before continuing to the others. 

He took a look at Jon, who stood proudly beside his future lady, [Alyce](/u/presidentfuncio). Jon had his lordly attire, while Alyce seemed to be dressed in a beautiful silver dress. [Jeyne](/u/hegartymorgan), Edmunds betrothed, seemed a little absent, but the blind girl had a soft smile on her lips. Oswin was also there, standing with Othello and [Meera](/u/gloude). Arlan then made sure to stand straight and proud, as he listened to Addam and Jon greeting.

Addam rode in first, at the head of the group, and gave a big smile as he saw the assembled group. He carefully slid down from his horse, his back aching a little from the long travel. ""Thank you, Lord Jon!"" he exclaimed as the others began to dismount their horses. Sheia carefully making her way down from the horse, her big belly showing through her dress. Closest to her was Nevio, who seemed younger than he was, still keeping himself close to his mother, his face in a false smile. 

The three girls, Jaena, Jayne and Adelayde had been chatting happily up to this point, faces bright with smiles and dressed in similar orange-green dresses. Jaena pointed over to the Arlan and Edmund and exchanged some hushed words with the other girls. They then turned respectfully to pay attention to their father, and that other Lord, whos name was Jon. ""Indeed, it is a pleasure for us all to be here."" he said. He paused a moment, looking over the group, and their beautiful clothes, and thought of his own, somewhat stained from travel. ""What is the occasion?"" He asked, giving a smile.",

Motivated by the his fantastic view of her beautiful body from his current position, he made the final sprint, he felt Falias muscles contracting and releasing. That accompanied by her moans made him sure that she was pleased. As her slight shudders ceased, he laid his head on her stomach, and looked up into her beautiful green eyes, a soft smile on his lips. 

Arlan traversed up her body, planting a kiss on her soft lips, and then carefully whispering into her ear, ""What do you want to do now?""

That is however very dangerous, as the army then has no obviois reason to follow their lord, and can give a bad reputation. Or, money can be confiscated from your local traders, to fuel the war machine. That is Short term only, and very bad for the future economy, but it gets the needed money. That is, of course, if the lord is not willing, or able to sell businesses, mansions and other goods he comes by. Otherwise, a simple promise of pay after the war will keep at least some soldiers in service. This can breinforced by debt papers, that can later be cashed in - by those who still live""

""Oh I'll have you begging me for more"" he said as he kissed her yet again, and stroked her cheek with his free hand. As Falia spread her legs, Arlan fully inserted himself, and was amazed by how much could fit inside her tight pussy. As  he picked up the pace, the swinging sofa slowly rocked back and forth, swinging the gardens around them. When Arlan could feel Falia growing weak with pleasure yet again, he silenced her moans with kisses and pounded her ever harder into the soft sofa. As he felt Falia begin to shudder, the pressure was growing within him, but he held it back as he held her tight with his arms, pounded her with his cock and she spasmed with pleasure. Only when her muscles relaxed and her pussy let go did he let the intense pressure and unimaginable pleasure release, as his manhood whipped out, spraying Falia with his load. Her face, her boobs, her belly, none were spared. As it happened, he let out a big moan of pleasure.

He fell down onto the sofa, exhausted and lost himself in her eyes. A few moments went by in silence as they looked upon each other. ""I love you Falia"" he said, and gave her a big kiss.",

So, for now we mostly need some peoples to get the sub started again, so anything is better than nothing.

So, when checking out an expansion, to see if it works or not, make sure to go through these steps at least.

1: Common sense, does the expansion make sense? Generally, this means that it borders previously occupied lands, that its not larger than one or two provinces, and that the roleplay makes sense.

2. Does the roleplay preceding or in the post justify the expansion? Generally, this isn't an issue.

3. Technology, can the civilisation support the expansion?

Generally, expansions are not more than two per week, are adjacent to the civilisation and except for that, I hope you can figure it out for yourself. I myself have never moderated expansions, but come with any questions you have.

Just tell me when you want to get started, and you can join the crew!",

He had pushed the thoughts of her out of his life, yet now they were returned. He was quite surprised as Jon seated himself next to him, yet it did not show. He listened intently to the words of the lord, his mentor, his close friend and near family. As he mentioned Ceryse, his eyes stung with sadness, and he managed to remind himself that she had not written to him, only to Addam. 

One thing however, that did take root was how family ties were not merely Ceryse, but Also the other Hightowers. He loved meeting new people, and his mind brought back a multitude of happy memories from feasts. Arlan carefully wiped the tears of his cheeks and looked into Jon's eyes. They were so kind, so friendly. Jon's words echoed through his mind, ""Positive"" he murmured to himself, ""Think Positive"".  And so he did.

A moment went by, Arlan had calmed a little. The first thing that came to his mind was that he would meet his three younger sib-... Aunts. They were aunts, Jaena, Jayne and Adelayde, all three pretty little girls. He smiled Ashe thought back to their last meeting. "" I'll get to meet them again"" he said out loud.  He would visit home again, for the first time in a long while. Ceryse would surely be proud of him, he thought. It would also give him a chance to meet the Hightowers sometime in the future. 

Arlan stood up from his chair, gave Jon a smille and bent over the table to give him a hug. A few moments passed as he sat down again. ""Thank you Jon"" he said, ""I think I've decided"" he paused a moment, ""You've helped me see the light in the situation"" think positive, he thought, 'I'll be going if not for Ceryse, my little aunts will be wanting to meet me again"" he smiled a little again, ""I'll make sure to give it a try, at the very least.""",

He had long awaited this moment, and he was proud that it finally had come. The sword dangled close to his face for a moment, as Jon was about to say the oath. He hardly noticed [Jeynes](/u/hegartymorgan) yelp of excitement. As Jon recited the words, he thought back to their many long discussions. A little voice in his mind reminded him of the priorities of a Lord. He quieted the voice as he stood himself up. 

Arlan carefully took the belt from Jons hand, simply holding it for a moment, while his mind took in the road that had taken him to this moment. The story of a squire, his story. A new chapter of his life had begun, Arlan had become a knight. He strapped on the belt and received Edmunds hug, returning it in kind. Then, he turned back to Jon, listening to his words. As he took the scroll in his hand, a lone tear ran down his cheek and fell to the ground. *Rest in peace, Garth*, he thought to himself. 

He carefully tucked away the parchment and said ""Thank you Jon"". He put his own arm around Edmund, "" Thank you Edmund, my 'brother'"". 

Addam had been standing with Jon the whole time, smiling as the event unfolded, proud of his grandson. At
Arlans three aunts had also been watching, amazed by their nephew, a knight in shining armour. The two could have fitted into almost any fairytale, they thought, the heroes who rescued the princesses. Their reaction had not been entirely dissimilar to that of Jeyne, though somewhat less skilled at hiding their excitement. 

""Congratulations Sers"" Addam said, big smile on his face, ""Let's celebrate!""

Righto!"" The guard turned out to the visitors, ""Welcome to New Barrel! You are expected!"" The guard left the battlement, and the gate slowly rumbled open, allowing the party to pass through.

One of the servants came bustling in, as Arlan was, together with Othello, telling the story of the war to the three excited girls, they had been listening intently so far. ""Ser Arlan, Lady Ceryse has arrived from Sunhouse. Lord Addam wants you to come. So, he gave the girls hugs, and headed of to get a change of clothing and to join his grandfather.

As the Hightower party passed through the gate, they entered a bustling courtyard. There were architects from all over westeros there to present their take on Port Foss, one of the grandest upcoming construction projects in thee country. 

Lord Addam came out from one of the inner buildings, dressed in his finery. The Hightowers horses were taken care of by servants as they dismounted. Addam headed up to Ceryse instantly, stopping in front of her. They stood like that for a moment, awkwardly looking at each other, neither saying a thing. Addam had grown old, his hair and goatee had started graying, deep crows feet at his eyes, lines in his face. The man had shrunk, yet seemed happier, family life had done him good. 

Addam smiled, ""Hello Ceryse, welcome back to New Barrel"", he offered her a kind embrace. It was up to her whether to take it or not.

Rooms to be more exact, the sun was setting over the little port that he himself commanded. He disrobed and sat himself down on his bed, a cup of wine in his hand.

It was weird how it all had turned out, he thought. Fate, something both his brothers scoffed at, had achieved this. 

He thought back to the moment he had been knighted, after all those years of training. He had wished for but a single thing - a shield of his own. His had always been blank, the curse of a bastard. Addam had been smiling as he listened ""Of course"", he had smiled. His grandfather - may he rest in peace, had granted him not only his wish, but also a name. That day ""Othello Flowers"" disappeared, and he became ""Ser Othello Foss"". He smiled to himself yet again, moving on.

He was getting married, something he had not been expecting to do back then - after all, who would marry a bastard? Yet, here he was, Ser Foss, commander of Port Foss.

Fate was a strange thing, the first of the three brothers to know true love had been Aemund. They had all been surprised when they heard. The first to do the deed was the youngest, he suspected. Arlan and Aemund had gone awfully quiet that evening, after Othello showed up. They had both been smiling, but Othello never got to know the story. 

Yet, each of his brothers would miss out on something, neither got the real deal. Maester Aemund would never marry, his proffesion sending him on a never-ending chase for his dream. Arlan had married to a woman he did not love, and probably never truly would. He would never let the sisters - his aunts go. He had relied more on them to handle the sorrow of Addams passing than they would ever know, or anyone for that matter, maybe not even him. 

He put his cup away, and let his head fall back into the pillows, closed his eyes. As he did so, Ayanna slowly came into focus, the woman he loved, the Lady he woumd marry.

He woke with a start, someone was knocking on the door. He sat up in his bed, his cup of wine still on the nightstand. He took his sheet and swiftly covered his modesty, and made for he door. It was late, the moonlight shining through the curtains, yet this was the Mansion, here were only friends. He opened the door, swiftly adding three words to the end of his thought - and loved ones. Still newly roused he saw Ayanna and smiled.

""Hello Ayanna"" he said, and gestured for her to enter, ""May I ask why I have the honor?""

The US is working on discarding net neutrality laws and the EU is working on a law that would give internet content a *20 year* copyright limit, and give holders the right to claim royalties when content is shared by links.

For that debate, head over to /r/netneutrality

You could take the same perspective on ISPs, whom could use a similar argument to say:

 ""Why should we allow access to competing companies via our services?""

""Why shouldn't we force companies to pay to 'use' our network?""

""Why should we allow users to share opinions via our services that don't reflect the company values?""

""Should I allow my company to promote or house expressions that don't align with what my investors think is financially beneficial to express?""

Now, how would that make you feel? Now, similarly to ISP's, when does an internet company become a ""Communication service provider"" (just created a term), and restrictions, responsibilities and neutrality become a thing?

Now the main problem with the censuration and net neutrality debate is the fact that the general populace doesn't understand the importance, and those who do understand either lack the power to affect it, or are to some degree in on the jig.

Does this analogy work? Do you see where my reasoning is coming from & headed?

A lord offering to mega-boost a vassals fortification should pose the following question fo the vassal - ""Can I afford to maintain a superfortress, will it be of any use or just bleed me for cash?""

We introverts have trouble reaching out of our comfy sphere to connect, but when we really do connect it is much more lasting and deep. 

The basic jist is that you have to keep the conversation going and get to know the other until you know them well enough not tk be uncomfy around them... This applies to dates as well. We go to dates to ~have a nice time~ get to know and evaluate your potential partner. No talking is a bad sign, so yes I would advice to keep the convo going.

One can think of a conversation like a game of ping-pong, where the ~conversation~ ball needs to be passed between the players. Don't leave the other hanging and the convo die. It probably wouldn't be good for your progress.

EDIT: On future dates, do think about what you want from the relationship, and if it seems it might become lasting, make that person a part of your safe bubble.",

What worries me however is the slippery slope we have begun sliding down with internet censorship.

Take a hypothetical scenario with ""oogle"", the worlds largest search engine. Let's say that they decided that dogs should be erased from the face of the earth. They implement this not by advertising killing dogs, but simply by excluding all happy and good things about dogs when you search the term ""dog"", and no longer showing places to buy dogs. This would lead to less dogs being bought in the long run (as everyone uses the amazing ""oogle"" to find what they read and want), and after a (long) while dogs begin to seem like awful, rabid beasts, since that is all that shows up when you search for them.

Now this was a hypothetical scenario. What are peoples reactions if you would say ""I don't use facebook"", then you're kind of a weirdo since that's what everyone uses. 

Now banning certain ideologies from the public does a few things. It shuns the moderates away from it, and prevent it from spreading, this might be good. What is not good however is the fact that it leads to self amplifying cess-pools which drive the ideology further towards the extreme.

I would actually say that this has already (to an extent) happened, where nationalist, fascist and racist views are cracked down on, the users banned from regular subs. What happens when the group you ban is large enough, they create their own communities and feed themselves with what they like.

I've heard a debate in Sweden, where the gov't is considering putting legal obligations onto, say google since they are effectively performing public service...

A certain degree of censorship would probably be good, but that censorship would only span the very extremes of the spectrum and users. Stuff that makes me feel bad is for instance the fact that at certain posts, horrendous amounts of comments are removed & censored, I've seen ratios upwards of 50% at times....

There is however the growing nationalist party that went from 0% ->4% -> 12% in the last few elections and is poised to become swedens largest party (30%) in the 2018 elections. While they wouldn't even be considered nationalist or alt-right by your standards they are called nazis, racists and white supremacists for simply acknowledging the fact that we have an immigration problem and wanting to adress it (by lowering immigration).

My second choice for claim is Denmark.

It is a very interesting country at this point in time, with quite a unique geopolitical situation. I believe that it would be a very interesting claim, even though I don't already know a lot about it.

* Played in /r/DawnPowers season two and three across multiple claims, including moderating.

* Played in /r/IronThronePowers as house Fossoway for a rough IRL year.

#####1st choice: Sweden

Because I like the country, live here and have read quite a bit om Swedens history & stuff. It is quite an interesting country that allows for a lot of options, and there is much history on the country, and plenty of other nearby players to interact with. Also, I have plans...

2nd choices: Serbia or Denmark, otherwise play as a 2nd IC in US or Russia

While I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge on any of these, I believe it will be interesting, and something I can engage myself in. These are in no particular order of preference, but I think they would be interesting.

Player in Dawnpowers season one and two, moderator in season one and helping with the season three reboot. I played as the Green apple fossoways in Ironthronepowers for an entire year, and then in Sevenkingdoms for a few months.",

Some explanation might be in order, this is my first proper ironman game (where I've lasted more than two generations). Started in the high medieval start in the as the one province independent count of Liubice, wedged between the HRE, Pomeralia and Denmark. 

With some skill and luck I managed to conquer the territories in and around Denmark/Poland/Germany, inherited England. Spread the glorious Waldensian heresy that now is the major religion, (only Italy and France are still catholic). Now I have my heirs wife on the throne of Byzantium, but the game will most likely end before I can procure it. Fun times and I had quite a great game!

EDIT: I inherited Trebizond as well.

EDIT EDIT: This is pure vanilla, no DLC or mods.

As a Swede I am experiencing this first hand. (sympathy, frustration and assumptions, both by me and others.) My point was not that there is a legal distinction, my point was firstly that most will not act upon their frustration, and secondly that within institutions it is important to stick to the rules, as rulings by immigration authorities can be seen as arbitrary by some immigrants, and lead to a frustration that they seemingly without reason have been denied.

The end solution is not immigration, but rather to get an end to conflict in the affected areas, and rather than import the populace, export civilization and our way of life to their countries.",

We have more steel and wood than we would ever know what to do with."" He paused for a moment, ""Well, I do believe that we should keep the trade flowing.

At first those unwilling to degrade to a lesser gameplay experience due to fewer DLC initially, and later on those unwilling to spend hundreds of dollars, just for a marginal improvement. 

I'd look to the model that Total War used with Warhammer, where owning both the first and the second installation granted an expanded experience with content that neither of the games give by themselves, thereby incentivizing the owners of the previous game to buy the new game, and the buyers of the new to also get the old (of course at lower pricing).

 Think in the way that paradox has released DLC previously, as an upgrade upon the old, where you need not necessarily buy the new, but you get a noticeable improvement. Thereby granting new experiences and a game that wouldn't be possible to sell as a single installation for 40$.",

Well kindof. I do make ""friends"" but it's not something that sticks.

In part it's probably my own fault. I tend to be very enthusiastic when entering a social setting, but when it settles down I'm just with those I happened to end up with, and with time... it slowly fades away. 

This is mostly due to the fact that I take less and less initiative the longer it goes without the other party taking initiative. 

I do have a group that I call my friends, but I haven't been able to hang out much with them lately due to studies, and many of them traveled away during the summer.

I try occasionally, to take contact with people, but get turned down usually for one reason or another. No one really invites me to things. Long holidays actually become the worst parts of life, because I don't meet anyone outside the family, when we go on vacation yaay, but it's still this aching feeling of not really having anyone.

I even managed to get a girlfriend, she lives in another city though, so we are apart a lot. In the beginning we talked to each other a lot and I felt like I had someone to share my life with - as long as it would last. I try to comfort her when she's sad and so, but even that is slowly fading away. Since I'm studying a lot I'm usually pretty busy but make time anyway for her when I can. Then she shared a photo on her Snapchat today that she was in my town. Sure, I have an exam tomorrow, but she could've at least said something. She hadn't mentioned it at all. Oh yeah.. and that's another thing, she's started watching YouTube and things on her phone while we're together now. Ouch

Oh yeah, and on top of that I failed my exams for this year. Yay :D

Sidenote, am most probably addicted to videogames and have been slowly working myself out of it.

Sorry for the wall'o text if someone actually read this.

TL;DR: have friends, sometimes, they fade away. Managed to get girlfriend, she doesn't really care about me anymore, failing my studies, probably addicted to videogames, have a nice day hope you're doing better

[Based on a spontaneous roleplay I hosted based on KaiserReich, details might be awry and more flavour added for the story.]

##Kaiserreich: A Spontaneous Roleplaying Story

Starring:

/u/Iceblade02 as GM and Author

someone else as the Player Character

###Prologue

The Man looked at the front page of *The Sacramento Times*. The date was *the 3rd of February 1936*. Rain droplets quickly started to make the paper damp, so He huddled it beneath his coat and kept reading. The big headline said *Berlin Stock Exchange Plummets*. People pushed by the Man, scurrying to their jobs. 

Before long, the Man had a goal in mind, and was heading towards the editorial office of *The Sacramento Times*.

---

###Chapter 1: The Journalist

*A few months later*

Ned smiled at the Man, ""Good morning, I hope you slept well?"", He stretched a little as the bright sunlight came in through the window, ""Yes I did, and you?"", Ned scratched his clean shaven chin a little, ""The usual, I was up all night making today's edition of the paper, but you know that by know. Anyhow, there is an event today I want you to go report on...""

Before long, the Journalist had scampered off from the office and was rushing into town. As He approached the  the crackling of a mic turning on could be heard through a pair of loudspeakers. ""*Ladies and Gentlemen...*"" a voice announced as the Man hurried forwards through the crowd, saying ""Excuse me, press, coming through"" to the bystanders he annoyed. He could soon see the announcer standing on a podium elevated above the crowd, the announcer continued:

 ""*..., I wish you all welcome to the Sacramento political debate of thirty-six. With me I have representatives for three different presidential candidates.*"", The announcer paused for effect, and a great flash came from the Journalists camera, capturing the announcer as well as the representatives on photo.

""*First off, representing Senator Huey Long and the America First party we have General Patton!*"", A few applauses came from the assembled crowd, ""*Back to his home state, all the way from Louisiana, welcome to California!*"" The Announcer exclaimed, meanwhile the Journalist had gotten out a notebook, and was making small jots here and there.

""*Then, from Massachusetts and representing Jack Reed and the CSA we have Mr. William Z. Foster!*"" At the edge of the crowd, a few burly workers, gave a few hoots for the representative.

""*Last, but not least, representing Charles Curtis and the Democrats, straight from Washington D.C, Harry S. Truman!*"", this time, at the mere mention of Curtis's name, an applause resounded through the square.*""

""Unfortunately, Garner could not garner a representative, so we will just have to do without one.""

After the introductions had been made, the different representatives were allowed to debate with each other, and it soon became clear where the different representatives stood ideologically. Foster was putting much weight on social issues, and the oppression of the working class, meanwhile General Patton was proclaiming the importance of every Americans duty to the US of A. While the two of them were talking anecdotes and ideology, Truman was speaking of economical reform, free trade, long term infrastructure investments and the importance of political debate.

As roughly an hour and a half had passed, the representatives were getting ready to leave, the Journalist had time to ask them one final question, ""If you had to name the single most important thing for you, what would that be?""

Foster instantly replied ""Equality above all else, no man, woman or child shall be left behind."", He was closely and firmly followed by Patton, ""America first, no compromises.""

Truman went quiet for a little while, pondering the question before replying, ""I firmly believe in that given the liberty to do so, every American can do great things.""

###Chapter 2: Three Candidates, Three Slogans, Three Solutions

Not long after, He sat himself down with Ned  and discussed the event. He ended - ""all in all the politics that the representatives presented were not that radical.""

Ned chuckled a little, ""Not so radical you say. Well, clearly they must've toned it down for our Californian audience..."" He took out two papers from his drawer, ""First off, we have Reeds politics in the *Chicago Tribune*, let's just say that it has the words 'capitalism', 'oppression' and 'burgoise'  in plenty, they even borrowed the slogan of the European syndicalist, *'Break the Chains'*.""

He shifted his focus to the next paper, ""Here we have *The Southerners Scribe*, practically written by Long himself. You'll find that he takes no distance from radical measures, and some of his followers even miss the Confederate days.""

The Journalist and the editor kept discussing into the small hours, and soon enough, the front page began to take shape. ""Last, but definitely not least"" Ned said, ""we need a title, any ideas?"", the Man thought for a few moments, ""How about this, *Three Candidates, Constructive or divisive?*""

Ned gave Him a nod, ""That sounds good, but I want you to rest now, there you'll have a long day ahead tomorrow.""

UG charts convicted rapists
NEWS Wed 22 Aug 2018

490 out of 843 offenders convicted of rape or attempted rape have been born abroad.

It reports SVT's ""Mission Review"" on Wednesday night's program.

""It is sociologically one of the relevant factors, but not the only relevant factor,"" said Jerzy Sarnecki, professor of criminology.

SVT's ""Mission Survey"", UG, has mapped all convicted of rape and attempted rape in Sweden in the last five years, from 2012 to 2017.

The program, which is broadcast on Wednesday, reports the statistics. In total, there are 843 offenders.

Many have been alcohol or drug-affected and the level of education is described as low.

But it is another issue that the program wants to highlight.

""It about the perpetrators' ethnic background. To seek the answer to that question has divided both researchers and politicians. Is it important to know or not? And the question is how it actually looks? "", Says Program Manager Ali Fegan at the beginning of the report.

490 out of 843 born abroad

Of the 843 perpetrators convicted of rape or attempted rape, 490 people were born abroad. It is 58 percent.

For assault violence, the figure rises to 85 percent; 110 out of 129 convicted persons in the past five years were born abroad. 40 percent have lived here for a year or less.

The review also shows that over half of the convicted offenders were born outside of Europe. Young men from Afghanistan are pointed out, 45 of those convicted of rape or attempted rape come from there.
Can not draw conclusions about everyone

Assignment review points out in the program that you can not draw conclusions about all rapists as the investigation applies only to sentenced ones - which is a small part of those reported and the crimes as the Crime Prevention Council, Brå, get information about.

- Now this debate is completely blinded, namely the only thing that is interesting is ethnicity. And I think that is sociologically one of the relevant factors. Not the only relevant factor. That the only factor being investigated is clearly due to the political discourse that exists in this society, says Jerzy Sarnecki, Professor of Criminology.

▪ Assignment review will be broadcast in SVT 1 at 20:00 on Wednesday, August 22 and at SVT Play.

Now don't be fooled by Jeezy, he is simply continuing on his crusade to say that all crime depends on socioeconomic factors. This is more apparent in the documentary that ""Mission Review"" (Uppdrag granskning) made on the topic and which this article is based on.",

From there I headed off into the Xpowers category where you essentially control a nation and it's people through time. Here I ended up on /r/DawnPowers, a fun little community with really nice people. It's been going on and off for a couple of years and is the reason I joined Reddit.

While DawnPowers was dead for a while I lurked in ironthronepowers, an RP subreddit set in the World  a Song of Ice and Fire, nowadays rebooted as /r/Sevenkingdoms you get to roleplay a character or family of your own creation, or one already in existence.

Then, I dabbled in the cyberpunk of Shadowrun and found /r/ShadowNet. While they are a bit different in their roleplay (it's mostly on discord), you can create your own character and roleplay it, either within the rules or just chatting with people through the guise of your character.

If you don't feel like any of that, there are three options.

I could do a small person to person roleplay with you over DM, (gonna have a week of vacation so got a little time) Could basically create one after preference of genre, I do soft roleplay though, so nearly no dice  or rules involved, just writing. 

Otherwise you can always do your own thing, writing, [finding another community](/r/roleplay) or meeting IRL people to do it, though that is hard.

If you're interested that is. 

Yes, I like roleplaying.

Without a de-facto Lord or Lady on the hill, they had not attended as many feasts and tournies as most others had. In particular her elder sister, whom had joined the Ashford everywhere they went.

And when the Knight had finished, she spoke, ""Thank you, See Llewyn, I will gladly show you my home. While I am not quite as well travelled as you are, I know the castle by heart."" She paused a moment, probably better than her sister, she thought, unlike her she had grown up here. ""Horn hill is a special place, at least to me."" She let the knight take her arm, and they rose up and soon left the room. 

As she showed him around, she told him of the castle. ""While not quite as grande as Highgarden, not as luxurious as the Arbor, nor as ancient as Oldtown, Horn Hill is one of the greatest castles of the Reach."" She paused a moment, looking at the knight, ""It has stood as a bastion of our house, and the Reach since time in memorial, defending against the forces of Dorne. 'Tis said that had Aegon not chosen the Tyrells as his Lord Paramounts, this would have been his second choice for capitol of the Reach."" 

They had come up upon the wall, the great castle towers and courtyard behind them. She gestured with her hand towards the forest below, and the shining lake. The water was quite still, almost undisturbed by wind. ""The forests about our hill have served the house well. Excellent wood for construction of the castle in ancient times, and for timber to build ships and wagons in more recent times. It is also teeming with game, excellent for our great Tarly hunts..."" She hesitated a moment, ""even though it was long since the last one, before my father was...."" Her sentence trailed off, and she gave a sigh.

She let the wind catch a little in her hair as she leaned against the parapet and gazed out over the lands below. She turned to the Caron Knight, ""How is your home? Nightsong and Harvest Hall?""",

EDIT: an excerpt from the discussion of the results

>Within  each  city,  the  frequency  of  victimization  and  per-
petration of psychological aggression, physical assault and
injury was similar between men and women. A meta-ana-
lysis  of  82  studies  assessing  aggression  suggested  that
women  were  more  likely  than  men  to  practice  physical
aggression acts and to do it more frequently while men were
more  likely  to  inflict  injury  (Archer
2000
).  Our  findings
appear to confirm this, favouring theories of social roles that
explain similarities in male and female IPV as a result of the
evolving   gender   equality   of   western   societies   (Archer
2009
).",

But I'd say like this, he's the local ""mob boss"" enforcing peace and his rule on ""his"" turf. Maybe not necessarily an evil guy, but he does not shy away from those methods. He would however have a certain ""honor among criminals"" to uphold, at least outwards.

He mainly utilizes his local goons to enforce his rule. He probably has the town guard in his pockets, might even have significant influence with the mayor of the city. 

You have three options for your villain, he can be either:

* ""The Puppetmaster"", working schemes from the shadows. An informant who slowly has risen to become the man behind the facade of the town, everyone in his debt in some way, through blackmail, threats, favors and money. He would probably try to deal with the heroes in an indirect way, maybe trying to lure them away at first with a quest out of town, a bounty or something similar. However, if they actually becomes a threat to him, he might put them in a situation where they become wanted by the town guard, by framing or other methods. Only give firm (thugs and direct assault) resistance when it becomes clear that the heroes will not deviate from their set goals. The challenge with this villain is finding who he is, and where he is, but when they do, he is likely alone, but always on the move, hidden behind layers of deception. Few know of him, and those who do are hard bought. (This villain might also turn out to be a woman)

* ""The wealthy merchant"" is most likely an old, rich man, and it is an open secret that every paid official in the city nurture themselves from the teat of his great mountain of gold. This allows him to delve into all kinds of lucrative enterprises, some legal, but monopolized by pushing out any who would oppose him, by any means necessary. Others, not so legal, prostitution, providing corpses and small children to questionable clients and similar things. He is protected by the system, always escorted by the town guard in his grande carrying booth, his house is guarded by mercenaries, and he has a pair of highly trained sellswords that flank him anywhere he goes. While he himself will be no challenge to dispose of, the problem is getting in a position to do so.

* ""The Strong Man"" is a figure who commands respect. Those who follow him do so either our of complete loyalty, or utter fear. He runs a protection racket on the town's merchants, thus funding his expenses. He kills anyone who disobeys him, but rewards those who are loyalty to him. The city guard are cordial with him, as long as he keeps the peace amongst the criminals of the city, they turn a blind eye. Everyone knows who he is, and thus finding him will be no challenge. He will likely send his henchmen after the heroes, and if they manage to get through them, he will attempt to deal with them himself. Killing this villain will be a challenge in and of itself.

She was dressed in her wedding gown, looking out over the Carnage below, the bodies, the executions. With her left arm, she rested upon the railing, and in the right was a glass of red wine. The hand that held it was gloved, but blood had seeped through it and was slowly running down to the foot of the glass, and dripping down beyond sight. 

Bethany was a mess, her wrists hurt, her head was throbbing as she looked down on her good-brothers head rolling on the ground, and his sons head following shortly after. The man's pleading words echoed in her mind. She supposed that she would soon follow, whether it was by her own hand, or by the hands of the Peake soldiers that would soon find her. She felt her eyelids drooping, she was tired. Soon she would join her husband, and they would be together again. Ellyn would never forgive her, she knew, but she never had forgiven her, she didn't understand. Bethany felt a little sorry for Alayne, but hopefully she was safe at least, wherever she was.

The glass started to fall, following the droplet of blood that had just left it, the woman that had held it coming down with it. It was as if the weight of the wine had suddenly become too much, and it all came crashing down. As the hand met the railing, the glass tipped and fell, slowly tumbling around its contents until it shattered upon the stones below, spattering red upon the two dismembered heads that lay there.

Up on the balcony, the soldier that found Bethany would catch her, and break her fall, hindering her from hitting the ground. It was clear that the woman had passed out, but maybe she would recover, given time.",

[Sorry for the delay, have some other quite hectic RPs going on in the nowtime]

She was a little surprised ""Another gift?"", she asked with curiosity in her voice. When they entered the stable and Llewyn introduced the dogs to her she got a little giddy incide. They did have dogs at Horn Hill as well, but her Great-Uncle Hectyr had made abundantly clear to her when she was young that they were *not* to be played with. They were pure bred hunting hounds, excellent for bringing down wounded game.

She gave a big smile at the sight of the pups and laughed a little at the sight of the little *rascal*, ""So two well behaved young girls and a mischievous little lady."" She lifted one of them up in her hand and stroked her a little on her head. She herself was just a little bit more fond of cats, the overjoyedness of dogs could become just a little too much at times, but she adored then all the same. She gave Llewyn a smile, and a ""Thank you"", before putting the little pup down again. ""They're absolutely adorable little fellows, and I'm sure they'll grow up proud and strong, just like you are.""

It made her think for a moment, one day she would have kids of her own, she had always thought of that day as far off, but the pups made her realize that the time was not far away, for both her and her sister. ""She looked into the knights icy blue eyes for a moment. After coddling the little pups for just a moment more, she took Llewyns hand and started slowly walking back towards the main building, and for a moment it was just them, the cold and the slowly falling snow. ""So, what do you think of me?"" She asked him cautiously.

Leo despised his father for his cowardice, but at least he had  chosen to stand and fight. 

Leo had a fierce look in his eyes, one that someone who knew his great-Uncle might have recognized. He had been in his first battle, and it would be his last. But he knew that Ellyn would punish the Peake Lord for his misdeeds, make him suffer. If there was anything he knew her for, it was for having a sense of loyalty and justice. *Just like the Tyrells taught her*, his great-uncles words echoed in his mind.

At least he would be with him again, with Hectyr. He remembered the staunch man, and a small smile edged in on his face, before it turned grave again, and he looked up into the eyes of the Peake Lord. ""I will only say this. All the pain and suffering you have caused upon others, you will live to feel it, both upon yourself, and your loved ones. If you are even capable of feeling that, Love, Compassion."" The words that he spoke were almost spat out, directed as much to the Lord himself, as to the men around him.

He resigned himself to his date, with the knowledge that he, unlike the one who ordered his execution, would find a good next life waiting for him.

Following Rogers lead, she took the chair next to him. She nodded at his words about their wedding, and the memories came flooding back to her. It was an interesting event for her to say the least. Yet some of the events had had an ominous foreshadowing to them, that she had not realized until afterwards. 

Lyonels reaction to Rogers words, and the silence that followed made Ellyn come to a realization. The man was a vessel without a leader, tumbling freely down the stream of life. If noone would captain him, nothing would happen. This prompted a small smirk from Ellyn, barely noticeable. ""Indeed it is"" she replied to Roger, taking over the lead of the conversation.

They would have to be captain of the Lord Paramount. ""It is good that you have returned, Lyonel"" she said, ""With neither you nor Lord Corlys, may he rest in peace, here, the Realm was starting on the road to chaos.

She paused a moment for effect, ""Your firm rule will be needed to put the realm back in order, My Lord."" Ellyn was firm with her words, but making sure to keep her words cool and tempered, like good steel. ""The killing of your brother was a great wrong done not only to you, but to us as well, his most loyal bannermen, his family, and now yours.""

The room was eery when the soldiers entered it, the canopy of the bed fluttering somewhat in the breeze from an open window somewhere. The Chambers were devoid of any life, an old painting of Bethany and her late husband Samwyle hanging on one wall, little Ellyn and her sister Alayne holding hands in the sunshine. But the painting was hanging lopsidedly, and a long tear went across the fabric, decapitating both Samwyle, and Bethany.

On the floor by the bed lay a dagger, it's blade stained with blood. Drops of blood created a trail leading off into the chambers, towards the outside wall. As the soldiers followed it, they found themselves in a living room, with two comfortable chairs and a small table in between them. A cup of steaming tea was on the table, and the carpet below it had a large red stain, reminiscing of blood that had pooled, and been sucked into the carpet. The morning sun was glimmering through a gap in the heavy curtains, a small red smear upon one of the edges. They moved a little from the wind outside, suggesting maybe an open window, or a balcony door behind them.

I propose an addition to the  ""Detection & Banners"" section (no. 7) to include a ""No banners"" option, particularly for small parties. Mostly for moving incognito, but I could also see it as an opportunity for more intrigue in the game. 

Running under ""No banners"" with a very small group (say within the group of 20 cap) should be quite powerful, and essentially allow these parties to pass by unnoticed, particularly if they disguise themselves as well. (if on foot with LI or RI escort, maybe allow to disguise as commoners, and if on horse with light cavalry disguise as merchants/wealthy burghers and with heavy cavalry as hedge knights) These groups might even be able to avoid the ""autodetect"" of villages and cities.

Running with no banners with a medium sized group (say 20-200) would simply not reveal any information about the heraldry of he group through autodetects unless further investigation is made.

Running under ""No banners"" with a very large group (say over maybe (insert arbitrary balanced number here) 400) shouldn't be possible at all, and with a large group (say 200-400) the heraldry of the army would quickly be recognized (if from another region, the region that the soldiers herald from, and within the same region, which house they herald from). Considering that we have mechs for captured banners and false banners on the way already, this probably wouldn't be all that hard to implement alongside them.

Well there he went to [Lord Roger's](/u/deaglcard) tent and debriefed him on the situation, bringing him with back out to the small congregation between the armies under escort by the Tarly soldiers who had guarded him in his tent.

Meanwhile, Ellyn continued speaking to Addam. ""Indeed, I understand your concern for the soldiers, it does indeed sound sensible to me. I shall have an honor guard of Tarly men, and Lord Roger will have one of Tyrell men under the same oath as my own. To uphold his honor as a Lord of the Reach.

If you feel the need for any more troops, we will be happy to provide them. He will have orders to follow the lead of your men, but to keep me informed."" She ended her topic there. ""I am ready to swear it, Sir, we are merely awaiting my husband. I would not do this on my own.""

As Ellyn finished speaking Roger arrived on site in the contingent and Ellyn gave him a small smile. Then she let I'm speak for a little, before they would say the words.

As they approached the sole warrior Lady of the Reach came into sight, her face was grim, and her features had hardened since the Oakheart Lord last saw her. The greatsword Heartsbane was swung upon her back, and a shield with the Tarly weapon, somewhat scarred from previous battle, hung from the horse. Around her were several of her closest knights, but Lord Roger was notably absent.

She gave the Oakheart man a look up and down before letting her eyes meet his. Ellyn did not quite remember him, but she knew he was the man whos father had killed her father. As her voice reached out, it was cold, and had a firm and decided tone. ""You would have had your hostages"", she began, ""had you and your allies not executed them."" She paused a moment, ""As I may very well be the last of my house, and given the previous treatment we have gotten from you as hostages, I am not going to offer myself as a hostage."" 

She paused for a moment, as her horse knickered a little. ""There is actually something that I can offer, something that I can offer you, something that noone else can. A man that commands loyalty and respect among the Tyrell soldiers, and unlike your good-brother is not currently imprisoned.""

She looked at the Oakheart Lord, gauging his reaction to her words, if this deal was struck, it might very well seal the future of the Reach, but mayhaps save the future of house Tarly, and secure a better relationship with the upcoming regime. *Better alive as a turncoat, than dead as a loyal hound* she thought to herself. 

""This would, of course, require a somewhat different relation than hostage and captor, a somewhat more... cooperative relation. But maybe you are willing to set aside old enmities to free your sister from captivity."" She ended, letting Lord Oakheart reply.",

As we all know, no ultimate ideology can be taken to it's end, not capitalism or socialism or anarchy or whatever. That's just the way it is.

The point I'm trying to make here is that it *could* work, it's a half finished idea spit out from my mind. I am no expert by any means in any field, just a random teenager using the internet to share his ideas.

On the 1st one, which one do you expect the state chooses? Would you let the government build you a smartphone? Why should you trust them with your health?

I believe it is imperative that competition be allowed in all fields, if State healthcare is clearly the better option, just choose them. Both the private one and the state one recieve the same funding (by taxpayer money) and in the end, you recieve the service free from whichever you choose. 

Your second paragraph is why the dismantling of larger corporations is needed, *because* they abolish capitalism by fooling the customer. Thanks for proving my point. Read my original comment and you'll see I propose the state slowly buying large corps and turning them into non-profits.

Last point, yes, obviously that is the case, but it is the idea to (in a contained enviroment) prevent a problem. If I would take over the world - I would implement this last one.

EDIT: Interestingly enough, *some* of the things I stated were actually implemented in Sweden during the 80s, but quickly got abolished due toooo... Can you guess? 

No, okay, I'll tell you, Lobbyism and companies leaving the country, they didn't fancy being slowly bought by the state with their own money. *Who would've thought* that *that* part would be what changed legislation, and not that a childrens book writer payed [102% income tax (yes, that's not a mistake, more than 100%)](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/12um7d/til_that_astrid_lindgren_swedish_childrens_book/)

Batteries are not production, they are a *buffer* to smooth out changes in both grid demand and production. The problem with them is that *just as you say* they can only store relatively small amounts of power. While this might be enough for Australian winters (the article you linked is from Australia) it most definitely won't be for Scandinavian winters.

Now, [here](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&nv=1&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=sv&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://second-opinion.se/hur-spannande-vill-vi-att-det-ska-bli/&xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700122,15700124,15700149,15700186,15700191,15700201,15700237,15700242&usg=ALkJrhiwinoacwzGsK_q7uMkADSo9yRTwA) is a translated article from Sweden on the topic of energy stability, and the need to cope with cold winters. The peak energy deficiency for a normal Swedish winter is about 1000MW, (some 5% of the total), and just about enough to fire up the oil powered reserve powerplants, so it isn't that bad, but when you take into consideration that we've had our wind park drop to as low as 5% energy production during winter, that exasperates the problem.

Now, that doesn't sound so bad, but that is your *average* winter. Here in Scandinavia, We keep track of roughly how often really cold winters come, so we have five-year winters (one in five years), ten-year winters and so on.

Now, for a ten year winter, the story is quite different. The estimated peak deficiency would be at 3000MW's, or 15% of grid total usage. This would mean having to shut down parts of our nation's power-grid, in the middle of a very cold winter. Now combine that with the fact that the swedish gov:t is shutting down our mainstay nuclear powerplants, decommissioning the reserve power plants, as well as killing of small hydro dams and replacing this with wind power (at a ratio of about 15MW's of new wind power for every 20MW's of Nuclear power decommissioned) this will make for quite a nasty surprise when it actually shows up.",

Also, venezuela is a shithole with problems that stem from the gov:t their government that swedish media is afraid to cover, because they cling to the idea that they are socialists. 

Yes, as always, it is important for the consumer to make informed choices, and that will *always* be a problem with capitalism, but my end goal would be to that the largest corporations slowly get stagnated and removed from the competition (by going non-profit while state-owned) to allow newer companies with new ideas to compete.

>Greetings, I have recieved words that our troops are still waiting outside the gates of Horn Hill. Has there been any word on the progress in negotiations? Is Lord Peake cooperating with us? 

>I have made sure to instruct Ser Henry Hunt to forward any letters to my current location, so send them to him outside Horn Hill, and he will make sure they arrive to me.

Free, merit based education for everyone (equality of opportunity), as well as healthcare for everyone (to a certain extent, security, police, research, public transit, infrastructure, power, etc. The most incredibly expensive treatments may only be partially funded by the state (one such treatment could probably fund a whole lot of other treatments for lesser ailments), or require an insurance of some sort. (this is all from my mind so tbd and open to suggestions). All areas that have government operations have to compete with private sector companies that get the *same* amount of funding per amount of job done. And if they get lower ratings from their customers than the state-funded ones get - they get theur funding revoked.

Now, I think there are some inherently good and some inherently bad things about a free market. Ideas get to compete, and may the best succeed: this part is excellent, but it also creates a problem. Wealth breeds wealth and the capitalism always abolishes itself. Here is where the radical part  comes in. We need some way of removing the wealth from the top and putting it back into circulation with the rest of the populace *that doesn't simply flatten out the top and remove the incentives for hard work and innovation*. 

So, what to do? Well, Japan has an interesting model where only unspent money is taxed (above a certain point of course), which discourages stacking money on a pile, and encourages economic growth. However, then there is the issue of corporations and wealthy magnates. An interesting theory to entertain would be that larger companies are taxed harder than smaller ones, and that this extra tax is used to slowly buy the shares of these companies until the state is majority shareholder, and thereafter essentially run them as nonprofit organizations, seeking to streamline the efficiency and employee benefits, stagnating the company and allowing other, smaller companies to compete in the newly created vacuum. Also, that upon death there would be punitive inheritance tax. So that up to a certain amount, all wealth passes on to the children (say 50k$ per child or some arbitrary number, and for each 50k$ per child above that, the tax rises by 1% (only applied to the rest of your wealth, so the first 50k$ would have no tax, the next 1%, after that 2% up to a maximum of 95%). This would mean that upon death, a substantial amount of money is passed on to the children (enough to make it matter), but when the wealth reaches ridiculous amounts, a majority is taxed away and returned into society to fund the state, thus not creating a wealthy elite that is inherited through the generations, and allowing everyone the chance to come out on top (or choose their path whether that be cooking, science or songs).

I know I don't cohere with your guys opinions fully, but I like to talk, and am open to ideas and stuff.

Good luck to y'all! (and sorry for the wall'o'text, this was just basically me spitting out my ideas)

Edit: so essentially TL;DR

I am a socialist of opportunity. Give everyone the same treatment and opportunities, but still allow hard work to be rewarded, thus benefiting the whole of society. BUT have punitive taxes that over time dismantle large corporations and mounds of wealth...

Edit Edit: Sorry guys, bad place to think freely, come at me with your downvotes and have a merry christmas!

P.S: I'm not gonna remove this in quite a while, so feel free to reply, or don't or whatever. Anyhow, I stand by my thoughts, at least in my head they make sense.

 (I usually clean out my post history from politics after a few months so this will disappear sometime in the far future)

The state slowly but surely buying out and stagnating the largest corporations would essentially put a ""best before"" on all corporations, dooming them to be eclipsed by newer ones who are (hopefully) more innovative. At least that's my idea. and when the corporation is turned into a non-profit (this would take many years though), you could (as I mentioned) streamline the operation to cut upper management jobs, as well as stagnating it would allow better worker salaries for those down at the bottom.",

[This part is under the assumption that the timeline I made is what actually happened]

After the judges had finished asking their questions, Ellyn continued, trying her best to keep to the points she had prepared earlier, and she was now talking around.

 ""It was when we marched, that I recieved grievous news. My castle had been stormed by enemy troops, my family killed, and my castle fallen to the hands of what my liege called traitors, sacked."" Elllyn trod carefully, hardly giving any of her own opinions, leaning on the statements made by others to justify her own actions. 

""Many days went by as we marched upon the road, before turning south. I knew that there would be no more shipments of grain from Horn Hill, no food to feed the soldiers, and no more taxes to pay them. I had a hard choice to make, letting my men starve as we marched through winter unto a siege that could last for months, or a dishonorable action that make me resented by some."" she paused for a moment, letting her words reach out to the audience.

""It was with remarkable ease that I ordered Ser Hunt to stay behind with five centuries of my men and empty the granaries of the village. My conscience let me off easily, justifying it as some sort of revenge for my dead family, but nay, it is never right to punish a subject for the actions or orders of their liege, even though it may have seemed so at the time. Yes, I ordered my men to loot the village, to bring supplies from the village, I do however recall it being eerily empty, only women, children and old men left behind, just like my castle of Horn Hill, now in the hands of the Peakes."", she sighed a little, ""I pondered having them killed, the commoners and the petty knights that had remained. I stayed my hand. 'What would this world be if we killed any enemy that came into our possession?', I asked myself, soon realizing that that was no world I wished to live in.""

She looked to the judges, ""Yes, I ordered my men to seize whatever supplies they could get their hands upon from that single village, but I massacred noone. And as I said before this trial even began, I am willing to repay that value in full, *despite* the sacking of my castle.""

""When we arrived at Starpike, I found that the other lords had already set up camp, and were many months into a siege. I reiterated my wish to avoid combat, asking the other lords to send an offer of surrender to the keep, despite their earlier refusal. They balked at me for even making the suggestion, and thus commited to building weapons of siege to bring the castle to the ground."" [Edit here] Before continuing, she added a small addendum, ""I did argue for taking supplies from the peasants around Starpike, but the Rhysling wouldn't habe any of it, and ordered his troops to burn the village to the ground, as well as the supplies therein. I do not understand why he would conduct such mindless slaughter."" [End of edit]

""Soon after"", Ellyn continued, ""[Lord Ryam Oakheart](/u/gochcymru) and his troops arrived. While the other Lords quickly surrendered themselves into his custody, and had their troops lay down their arms, knowing their families were safe in their Castles, a threat if they were harmed. I had no such luxury or comfort. My castle was taken, my family dead. I have no heir of my name. The faithful soldiers of my house were the only thing standing between me, and utter ruin. So, I negotiated.""

She looked to the representative of the Lord whom she had negotiated with, or at least with his delegate. ""I layed down my arms and disbanded my troops in return for a guarantee of my Ladyship of Horn Hill, the safety of myself and my House, as well as the promise that he would hold my keep ransom until the end of the war.""

Ellyn finished talking for a moment, requesting something to drink. ""Once more I leave room for the judges to ask questions, but I am yet to finish.""

It was certainly only a formality, but it had a certain weight to it. After it was finished, Ellyn looked to the [Judges](/u/FuryIsTheMindKiller) [sitting](/u/Nomidin) [in](/u/Lord_civ) the room.

""To properly understand this case, we need to start at the beginning"" she said. ""Over a year ago, I recieved a letter that the Lord Paramount was dead. When I received word that the inheritance was in question, the troops were mustered and we headed to Highgarden.""

She paused a moment, ""When we arrived, Lyonel was already installed as Lord Paramount. Thereafter, he was informed of the situation here in the Reach, as he seemed be quite worryingly unknowing of all the events in our fair realm. Not only this, but he was half drunk at the early hour I got a hold of him. Regardless, I advised him to order all the involved lords to his presence, to *hopefully* settle the manner in a peaceful fashion. I even had the servants serve him water, in a hope to clear his mind.""

She paused, a moment, looking to Roger, the one who had been present at the meeting. She did not know the name of the servant that had been present, but she did assume that in the case that the judges questioned both her own word, and rogers, he could be brought forward as an independent witness.

""After this, I readied my men to march back to Horn Hill, the matter that I had roused them for was clearly settled, with the inheritance finalized. I had no desire for battle in the cold of winter, even as my funds were running short."" She looked to the Hunt Knight that was standing among the other witnesses, he knew she had been preparing to [lead her soldiers home](https://www.reddit.com/r/SevenKingdoms/comments/a4zuy2/event_there_is_your_sword/ebitemf/?context=3).

""Yet, even as I did so, Arthas Rowan, the Lord Commander at the time, showed me a writ of arrest and stated that you, *Lord Protector*"", she looked at Lorimar, ""Were to be taken into custody. I can only assume that he sent a messenger earlier to let you offer yourself up peacefully, but that I may never know. Regardless, *he* ordered the assault, and as it were he was my superior, with writ order from my liege. I did not question him, but maybe with the knowledge of hindsight, I should have.""

She sighed, she did not like being put under scrutiny, but she did her best. ""I would argue that it was not I who broke the Kings peace, but rather Lord Arthas, and beyond him Lyonel Tyrell.""

She paused for a moment yet again, ""For this, I believe my actions that followed speak quite clearly. When the Ashfords and Rhyslings and Rowans and Serries rushed headlong off to siege the keeps and holdings of those they believed to be the enemy, I stayed behind, and waited. I waited almost *three months*, content to guard the Lord Paramount at Highgarden. It was only when he himself sent me explicit order that I marched therefrom upon Starpike with my men, as well as those of our Paramount house.""

She looked at those around her, pushing the point home that she had not been the one to initiate hostilities. This was however, only the first part of her defense, making clear that she was no initiator of hostilities. ""I am not finished yet, but if the judges have any questions for myself or any of my witnesses, I give you room to ask them.""

It is only when they are in high quantity close to people it becomes a problem, not for the enviroment, but for health. As the Diesel burns at higher temperatures, it creates certain compounds that are toxic.

Arguably, the solution that the manufacturers presented was elegant, run on high temperature in non-urban enviroments, thereby burning the fuel efficiently when NOX is not an issue, and run on lower temperatures in urban enviroments, to limit NOX. The real problem is that they weren't honest about what they were doing, not what they were doing per sé.

One of the big things with Diesels though, is that many can run on organic fuel, it should be important to invest in this (it would also solve the NOX problem). ",

>So, it is fair to say an electric car has higher emissions right up until it rolls off a dealer’s lot. But after that, the conventional car rapidly catches up and eventually passes the electric car in total lifetime emissions.

Today we produce about 1.5x more food than we actually need to. Streamlining our food usage would free up a *lot* of land, it is an interesting problem to consider though, maybe someone should crunch the numbers on it?

>You should copy them

Unlike Norway, Sweden is not filthy rich from oil, we do however have quite extensive usage of biofuel! Proof of concept that it does work. Right now, about 40% of diesel fuel burned in sweden is biodiesel rather than fossil fuels, and 5% of petrol is as well.

>it produces drastically less air pollution

He needed to be able to do it himself, without a watchful eye.

The young man gave a ""Thank you"" when the servant returned with the platter, this bread and cheese seemed quite important, he noted. He took a slice of cheese, and ate it together with the bread, quite filing food, and tasted good enough. When he had finished, he settled in front of the statue of the Warrior, going down to his knees. 'This will be a long night', he thought to himself. ""Thank you for the food, Septon"" he said, studying the face of the man who was one of the most powerful in the realm, yet not quite so imposing.

Before he truly began his vigil, he looked around at the different statues. The Father, just, and right. His own  father had been executed, in the name of false justice, by a man anything but honorable, he felt a small sting of sadness. His Greay-Uncle had however been more of a father than Cliff ever had been, yet he had also perished.

The Mother, ever protecting, hopefully keeping his own mother safe, for she was out of his reach, yet he had told himself he would return.

His gaze fell upon the Maiden, ever beautiful. If his little sister was still alive, he hoped that she was allright, still merely the girl. He also could not help but linger upon the fair form of the statue, but soon caught himself staring, and moved on, somewhat ashamed with himself.

Old and wizened, the Crone, a representative of the old and wise. The only person he could think of was Edric, who had mentored him these last few years. Noone in his family had ever come near the age of that old Lady, all dead, one way or another.

He paused a moment, as his eyes reached the Stranger, the one who had taken away so many of his kin, so many, far too early. He shuddered a little, and let his eyes return to the statue in front of him. He had never been particularly religious, but it was hard to not think about it in this imposing locale.

Last but not least, the Warrior, his own guardian, and the idol of what he would become, what his great uncle Hectyr had been, a protector of the house. He let his head fall for a few moments feeling the sadness of all those passed away well up. As he lifted his gaze once more, he pushed it all away, and a single tear fell upon the stone floor. 'I must be strong for them' he thought to himself, as the long vigil began.

He noticed the glowing violet eyes of the lord, surely of some Valyrian heritage far back. 

As he spoke, his gaze fell upon that of the young mans wife, a woman to be sure, but quite bland, and a little round around the edges, ""Your wife?"", he inquired to the Lord, the flowery perfume wafting in the air, and reminding him of the miss that had caught his eye a few moments earlier.

I also provided an EROI for  biodiesel, yours is severely outdated. The approximate return of investment is 5.54x for biodiesel made on soybeans, (i.e a gain in energy of 454% vs the energy invested, if you use 100% biodiesel energy to power your operation.)

Well, GMO should most definitely not be banned IMO, be clear and honest with what you do though. GMO's are excellent for increasing yields, and growing crops where it otherwise would not be possible. (they've made rice that can grow in salt water now!) We are constantly moving towards more efficient agriculture, and we can already feed everyone, it's just that we choose not to. Reducing food waste would not cause mass starvation.

Also, biofuels in Sweden have the same tax rates as regular fuels, both CO2 tax and fuel tax. They remain competitive however, regular fuel companies now sell diesel that is 42% renewable. Also, biofuels do not *move* the pollution, they cancel them out. Biofuels have the same local CO2 emissions as other chemical fuels, but they do not contribute to GHG emissions due to their short CO2 cycle. and, since the trees and crops used to make the fuel do not run out, and are easily regrown, it does count as renewable, also, bioenergy literally means energy from biological sources XD. Sweden also does not use any palm oil in its biofuel. 49% of the resources for biofuel are swedish, and another 43% come from the US, Netherlands, Finland and Belgium.

After having a look around to get my own look at wind power space efficiency, I found a source citing roughly 1W/sqm, so with that under the belt, let's see how much space it would take to power Sweden.

We consume 16MWh/person/year. This means that 1 sqkm can support 547 people (assuming that its production is spread out evenly, which it isn't). Sweden has a population of 10 million. That means it would take 18'000 square kilometers to supply the swedish population with electricity, an area almost the size of Slovenia. Let's apply this math to the entire world. Let's be generous, and say that wind power *only* has to supply 40% of the worlds energy consumption. 

So (1/1'000'000sqkm)x(((1.575*10^17Wh)*0.4)/(365days*24h))=7'168'949 square kilometers, which is roughly the size of Australia. That needs to be covered in wind farms, one way or another. And this is with the generous estimate of 1W per square meter, which only about 3-4% of land has the potential to generate equal or more than. But, I don't know, maybe that doesn't constitute ""space issues"" in your mind...

Also, just FYI, sweden does not burn any coal, at all. It does however have  two fuel oil reserve plants, and a single regular use natural gas plant. 

Also, Swedens CO2 emissions per capita are half those of Norway, so maybe the Norwegians should learn something from Sweden instead.

Aegon looked his own age maybe slightly younger, but the girl... Not so much. It was however quite clear that they didn't appreciate any concern for the girl, however well-intended it might be.

""I've lived here in Kings Landing with my sister and cousin for almost four years now, but we only moved in here to the Red Keep recently."" He told [Aegon](/u/Lycandus), not mentioning the rather gruesome fact that most of his house had been murdered, slain, or executed at the hands of a single man during those years. It didn't make for very good small-talk, something noone really wanted to think about.

He didn't know why, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something odd with the girl, so silent all the time, never looking up to meet the faces of those around her. It made him think a little of himself before they had left Horn Hill, always made fun of for being so skinny, he had prefered to disappear.

Only after the excitement of the escape, setting the Florent camp alight and fleeing through Dorne. It brought a new drive into his life, a passion that he had not had before, and after that, the new enviroment in Kings Landing, and eventually shooting in height above his peers. Just like he towered over both Aegon and his little sister, still mostly bones though.

He gave a small smile to the girl, ""You two live here at the keep?"", his body language suggesting he was aiming his question at both of them, rather than just the brother.

(just like with paper).

[Here is a lovely article on the pros and cons of electric cars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_aspects_of_the_electric_car), you should read it! 

Also, an article on [the production cost](https://www.theicct.org/publications/EV-battery-manufacturing-emissions) of an electric vehicle.

Electric vehicles and combustion engines run on biofuel are two polar opposites.

Electric vehicles are expensive and resource intensive to produce, and trade local pollution for global pollution and enviromental destruction. (cutting down [amazon rainforests](https://kids.mongabay.com/elementary/505b.html) and polluting local rivers for instance, while searching for rare earth metals and other lovely things). However, they have another caveat as well, they are only as clean as the energy they use, as well as usually being very short range (particularly an issue in our nordic countries). Maybe this is something that can be improved upon in the future, I personally have high hopes for hydrogen power cells.

Internal combustion vehicles run on biofuel are a very known factor, an improvement on tried and proven tech. Same initial production costas regular vehicles, zero carbon footprint from fuel, and it spreads its pollution equally everywhere. Something that I have noticed while reading though is that significant advances in filtering tech have been made lately (despite all the dieselgate stuff), so hopefully this is a trend that will continue, so that PM's and NOx won't be an issue at all. 

The sad thing is that sweden had proper biofuel refineries up and running for ethanol (this has the same PM and NOx emissions as petrol and is biofuel!), but then they slapped it with the same fuel tax as for fossil fuels, which killed it sadly. We could've gotten a lot further if they hadn't. I personally think it was a cynical move, because ethanol had gotten too popular and was cutting into the tax revenues.

And on the topic of your addition, there is nothing ""natural"" with ""natural"" gas, it is a fossil fuel. If you want the renewable one you want Biogas, which is created from household waste and sewsge, something they use for public vehicles here in Sweden, pretty neat, but smells like literal shit.

Oh, and for electricity generation, Nuclear power, and then fusion once we have achieved that!


P.S, going to sleep now, but I'll reply to any reply you have in the morning, love a constructive debate! I do see where you're coming from with the electric vehicles though. I think there might be a point to electrify busses and maybe taxis as well, vehicles that are constantly operating in urban enviroments in large cities, and last for a long time. Thus you'd get the most ""bang for your buck"", decreasing the pollutants with as little emissions elsewhere as possible. ",

Noone truly knows where any loyalties lie anymore, but one thing is certain, there will be war in the reach once more.""

If you do, you may disregard anything I write and go live in your lovely bubble.

And if it's not africans, then it'll be mexicans if you're in the US, along with some south americans, along with texas becoming unliveable. Climate change is real, it will affect everyone, some more, some less. Where I am at, the summers are becoming a cozy 35 celsius instead of the usual 26, and the winters are all but disappearing.

Facts:

 Biodiesel has an effective zero-emission on a global scale, since it is produced from trees and plants grown within a reasonable timescale (short CO2 cycle).

[Biodiesel has lower PM emissions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032111001377), and is thus less harmful to health than regular diesel.

[Biodiesel has less NOX emissions under low workloads](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef0700073), which means that it in urban traffic leaves less harmful emissions.

Biodiesel is renewable, and won't run out.

Step 1. to reducing all emissions is to not use an engine larger than what you need. If you have any interests at all in bettering your enviroment, this should be the go-to.

NOX causes Asthma and irritation of the nose and throat (quite harmless all things considered), as well as a slight increase in methemoglobin, which unless it is frequent, has no effect.

PM can cause asthma and irritation, as well as increase the severity of already present respiratory diseases or cardiovascular diseases.

The US manufacturers also cheat on their emissions tests, just not as much.

For that, my family has payed dearly, and the Peake Lord still occupies my own ancestral home, as well as that of your family."", she gave a nod to the Tyrell Knight, continuing into summaries of many of the events that had occurred.

Back in the ancient days the Lords and Knights would ride out for an entire week, hunting game in the great expanses of forest that surrounded it. Over the years it has become more of a tradition for the entire house, and the local knightly houses. Afestival if you so will. An event for everyone."" Damon let himself make gestures to enhance the little tale, not large ones, just enough to illustrate the memory that he had since childhood. 

""During that week, everyone is gathered to Horn Hill with dancing, music and games every evening, and an overnight trip out into the forests for any who dare. I remember me, my brother and my sisters sitting at the fire, huddled together and watching the stars, singing songs as the fire slowly burned."", he smiled fondly and then chuckled a little. ""Well, and then of course the more gruesome bits. The hunters *did* bring back some magnificent venison though, and it lasted for the entire week back in Horn Hill. Lots of fun and merriment though!""

He let silence fall for a little bit, and rested his hand upon Olyvia's shoulder, ""There is always so much to see"", Damon said, slowing down a little, ""So much to do, and so much to experience."", he pressed his lips together a little, ""and far too little time."", after a sip of wine, he looked at the young woman next to him, somewhat thoughtful. ""So what is it you want to do, Olyvia?""

""Of course, I hope it has been pleasant."", she commented, ""I will indeed be joining you back to Highgarden.

I will, of course, remain at your disposal should you need any tasks accomplished.""

Lady Alayne looked to [Jonathan](/u/HouseMeadows) for a moment as well, ""Your gatekeepers expressed dismay at the men I brought. I had hoped to put any worries to rest with this, but apoligize nonetheless. It is of course unnerving, and I will do my utmost to secure Horn Hill once more to avoid a repetition.

EDIT: Just noticed a reply after posting this.

""Well, I will be joining the Lord Regent for some time, at least until Horn Hill is recovered, so it would be good if we were on the same page."" The Tarly Lady replied to the Meadows Lord in a cold but polite tone that had come after many discussions in the capital with some people she would rather not mix with. She harbored no ill will towards the Meadows, but if they decided to back the Peakes - the young Lord might become a thorn in her side during her mission to reclaim her home from the Peakes.

Lady Alayne Tarly approaches the gates with a garde of twenty men. The knights of the garde are on the lookout for Peakes and Florents upon the battlements, and make sure that the Lady is shielded from any potential arrows that these men could loose. Once they reach the gate, one of the knights hails the gatekeeper. The Lady along with two knights will go through the gate if allowed.

She listened to the Peake, many of the things she heard, she had expected, yet one thing did stand out, she had never said anything about Addam to the dornish Prince that sat upon the small council.

Once the detestable Peake had closed his mouth, Alayne spoke yet again, her gaze fixed upon Lorimar ""I have only spoken the truth, and connected a few dots. As for omitting that you killed Lord Paramount Corlys in a trial by combat, it was so you could say it yourself. You won the duel against your Lord Liege. Killing him was optional, but not unlawful. I am sure [Lord Serry](/u/SerGiggles) can attest to what happened.  Had you not killed him however, none of us would be sitting here today and thousands of lives would have been spared.""

She gave a moment for the words to sink in. ""Now, I knew that my sister had gone to Highgarden to investigate his death and ensure the succession. The first I heard of war however was you and your armies arriving to my home, promising death to every man and woman within the castle unless your will was fullfilled.""

""Meanwhile at Highgarden, Lady Ellyn had been following the orders of her superior, just like the men of many other houses, Hightower included."", she gave a glance towards the [hightower representative](/u/MournSigil), ""It was only after she recieved word that her family in Horn Hill had been slaughtered that she marched upon your house in earnest, trailing far behind others like Rhysling and Ashford. You may have falsely believed that she had your smallfolk killed, but she would never do such a thing, and never perpetrated such an act. As far as I am aware, the house responsible for those deeds is Rhysling. I do not raise the case for the actions taken against house Rowan, especially considering that Arthas Rowan broke guest right, misled mine own sister, and apart from yourself is the greatest cause of the tragedy that is our fair realm.""

Alayne sighed, ""This does not change the fact that the trial in which Lady Ellyn was judged was false. Regardless of whether she did, or did not perpetrate any such acts, the jury that judged her would have accepted any verdict you spouted out. The fact that Ser Addam attempted to defend Ellyn against your men does however speak volumes. Indeed, as you said yourself, she did not stir when he and his family was cast into the dungeons. If this man risked his life and freedom to defend her, there must have been quite compelling reasons to do so considering he was your co-regent.""

Now, here came the two major points, ""Even if all those actions were just, which they were not, it does not make the murder of Lord Paramount Lyonel the Second any less dishonorable, and that alone would be enough to have you executed. Prince Maron must have confused him with Ser Addam.""

""I hate to have to repeat myself, but it seems you are either woefully or willfully ignorant of my family line. With the death of my sister, I inherited the Lordship of Horn Hill and thus am its Lady since she has no line of her own. After myself, the first in line would be Ser Damon Tarly, who was just the child when you attacked our house, the son of the only brother my father had, and the only remaining male in the Tarly line of inheritance. After him would come his sister, as the eldest daughter of the second son. The two younger sisters of my father were in regular marriages, one to Rowan and one to Florent. Thus, Amerei is a Florent, not a Tarly.""

Once she had finished, Lady Alyne looked to the [Prince](/u/Dasplatzchen) to lead the discussion.

House Ashford was forced to swear fealty to Starpike, as well as ceding villages to its domain. House Rowan  was unlanded, for allegedly murdering two Osgreys, and a cadet branch was seated in Goldengrove,  several villages changed hands. House Serry was forced to swear fealty to Brightwater Keep, allies of the Peakes, and their vassals, the Balls, were nominally raised to lordship. As for mine own home, nothing was done, since the Oakhearts had promised its return when my sister and her husband layed down their arms on behalf of mine own house, and house Tyrell. So, after the end of the negotiations, she was released, and headed back to Horn Hill, only to find that the Peakes and Florents were still occupying it. When it became clear that they would not uphold their end of the bargain, she informed Lorimar of how she could be contacted and went into hiding. The Peake did not take contact, and instead endeavored to elliminate his colleagues in power, and soon, he had effectively removed the Hightower representative through intrigue. Soon, the self-appointed 'Lord Protector"" as he styled himself, gave a promise of fair negotiations to Lady Ellyn, backed up by a guarantee from her grandfather, Lord Ball.""

Alayne paused a moment, taking a breather and drinking a little, ""So, she came to Highgarden of her own volition, but was instead faced with a fast tracked trial, with Lorimar himself as head jury, and his ally Florent, and their vassal Ball joining them. Lady Ellyn did of course protest this, as the jury was obviously rigged, with Lorimar himself sitting upon it, whom had clearly stated that nothing but Ellyns death would satisfy him, in spite of  previous guarantees. It would seem that the Florent jury was bribed with the promise that Horn Hill would be granted, the impostor Amerei Florent in Horn Hill is living proof of this. What occured within the walls of Highgarden, I know not, and Lorimar was quite diligent it seems in killing off, or discrediting any who know the truth. In the events surrounding this, many were killed, I can only assume that Lady Ellyn protested a false verdict, for alleged crimes that she had not commited, refusing execution, and that conflict ensued, which Lorimar used as an excuse to kill of Lord Paramount Lyonel II as well as many others that could raise voice against him. Maybe Addam Tyrell, who was in Highgarden at the time, can fill in the gaps of what information Lorimar is withholding.""

Alayne was both telling the story, and building a case. She told her view, as well as sharing any who could know more on the subject.

""When word reached me of Ellyns death, I investigated whether the Reach was safe to return to to assume my inherited position as Lady of Horn Hill, but it was still occupied by those who had killed many of my kin, and any letters I sent went unanswered. So, I began my task of restoring order in the Reach, to do this, I had to inform the crown of all the information that had eluded them for so long. In light of this, Lorimar was called to the capital, and after a.... heated... exchange with the Small Council, they deemed him to be uncooperative, and appointed you as Regent in his stead. I'm sure you've heard this from Lord Brynden as well, or maybe experienced it firsthand even. So, I returned here with you, hoping to restore at least a semblance of order and peace to the Reach, as well as reclaiming my home from those who wantonly took it."", she concluded her tale, letting it sink in, and awaiting a response from the prince.",

She was quite nervous, maybe even more so than she had been when talking to the King himself, a lot hinged on her performance now.

""Thank you"", she said to Daeron, ""As I was introduced, I am Lady Alayne Tarly of Horn Hill, the younger sister of the now passed Lady Ellyn Tarly."" Alayne paused a moment, contemplating the death of her sister as a scribe scribbled in the corner of the solar. ""As we all know, my ancestral home of Horn Hill was occupied by the Peakes during their rebellion after Lorimars killing of Lord Paramount Corlys Tyrell, and swearing fealty to Lyonel the Second. With this, Lorimar continued to murder and slaughter, killing all my kin, except myself, and my two cousins whom had managed to escape in a stroke of luck. My sister laid down her arms when it became clear that the war was decided, outnumbered and surrounded. But, not before making certain that her home would be returned, treating with the Oakhearts. As far as I am aware, they upheld their part, ascertaining in the peace that was brokered that Horn Hill would remain, as it always has been, with house Tarly.""

""This was however not satisfactory for the Peake. He intended to use his newfound power to extend the vile reach of his and his accomplices. Thus, it was that houses Ashford and Serry were forced to swear fealty to new lieges, Serry to Florent and Ashford to Peake, both houses that had honored the call of their Lord Paramount. Not only this, but the Balls of Cobble Cove were elevated to Lordship.""

Alayne knew she was pinning all the accusations upon the Peakes and Florents, despite the fact that the Oakhearts and Hightowers too had partaken in the rebellion, and that Oakheart and her allies had most certainly benefited. Nevertheless, that was not a battle that she would fight.

""With this out of the way, Lorimar sought to solidify his powers and his gains, beginning with removing the Hightowers"", she looked towards the Hightower representative, ""from the newly established regency council. Then, under the false pretext of negotiations, Lady Ellyn was invited to Highgarden. Instead, my sister was faced with false charges and a rigged jury, consisting of the Lord Peake himself, who was the accuser, as well as their closest ally Florent and their vassal Ball. Doubtless, the promise of Horn Hill to the Florents had been made beforehand, effectively making sure that the Peake could dictate any verdict.""

Alayne paused for a moment, making sure to let her words sink in. ""While I do not know for certain what occurred in the Great Hall, I expect that Lady Ellyn protested the verdict in some fashion, and that Lorimar used this as an excuse to kill her. In the chaos that ensued, Lorimar made sure to eliminate all that could question his power, incarcerating Ser Addam Tyrell and sending his men to murder Lord Paramount Lyonel Tyrell and several other members of House Tyrell, not unlike what he did in Horn Hill. If the council wishes to further investigate Lorimars vile acts, there are witnesses as well, prime amongst them Ser Addam himself.""

Alayne knew that the part she knew the least about likely was the part that would likely be what worked most in her favor. ""Last but not least, Amerei Florent holds no claim to Horn Hill, and neither is she a Tarly. My cousins and I are all of the Tarly name by birth, and however the lines of inheritance are bent from my sister, even without considering myself, my cousin Ser Damon Tarly, and even the Rowan branch of my house would take presedence over the Florent cousins. Regardless, I believe I have made quite clear that Amerei Florent being chosen has nothing to do with her Tarly lineage, and everything to do with her house and its allies.""

""If there are any questions, I will be happy to answer them. Nevertheless, my stance on the matter is clear, Lorimar Peake should be put on trial for his crimes, any decisions and writs that were made during his false regency should be rescinded and House Florent should have her seat upon the council removed due to their role as his accomplices.""

Having finished talking, Alayne looked around the table, waiting for the chaos to break out.

Whatever you do, and whatever the others do, remain calm, a cool and tempered Lord can command the respect of his peers."", when she had been speaking, she had grown quite serious. The young Lord was bold, and while it was a boon, it could also be his downfall.

""The Florents, Peakes and Oakhearts are unlikely to heed any words you contribute with, I hardly need explain why. The Meadows Lord is young, I think he might be more receptive than his elders to your sway, you and him will outlive many of the others who will be there. Gaining his trust and respect would be a great help, even if he might not deserve yours. His house has been in the shadows for long, give him a hand when the Peake falls, and he might take it. The Prince has his fingers in all pies, but he will have been predisposed to agree with the Meadow and Oakhearts, for the are his kin. Last but not least, the Hightowers. They are the most powerful house at the table, they value stability. Show them that you are capable, and to be counted on, and they may listen to you in the future.""

Having made a rundown of the houses there, Alayne was laying out her action plan in her mind, and shared it with Lyonel as well. ""The day will likely focus on two or three issues."" She began once more, ""The Florents will be at their center, they were granted the Serries as vassals. The Serrys are a loyal and honorable house that were loyal when others rebelled. Hopefully, they will be restored their position as direct vassal. They would be a valuable ally, and speaking out in their favor over the Florents could be helpful."" She paused, ""Secondly, mine own home. Amerei Florent, my cousin, has seated herself as Lady and stolen my ancestral home. This issue will be hard to resolve, and I will do my best to discredit the Peakes and Florents. Be warned however, the Peake may prefer war to concession.""

She was approaching the end of her ideas, but one issue that might be raised was the Arbor, some said they had not been paying taxes, and if the Peakes and Florents were removed from the council, an elegant solution might present itself. ""Last but not least, the Redwynes. Once the council is culled, it might be prudent for you to suggest replacements, in part to keep those on it weak, and in part to replace enemies upon it with friends. The Redwynes are a powerful vassal, and bringing them up as a candidate might be sensible to appease them."" Alayne sighed, having finished.

""Now"", she looked at Lyonel for a moment, her eyebrows furrowed slightly, ""What do you think of all this?""",

Damon gave a big smile as he led Olyvia onto the Dance floor, admiring her as she spun around, she was quite the sight. When they took hold, it was quite clear that this wasn't the first time the young man had graced the dance floor. 

""Well, I would say so, but that is ultimately for you to decide, Olyvia."", he said as a reply, letting his eyes meet hers, as he kept attention in his peripheral vision for any other couples he had to manuever them around.

He remembered a time before he had been to Kings Landing, when his elder siblings had considered him deaf to the tones of music. Much had happened since. He still remembered the first time he had taken a girl to the dance floor. Almost three years now, he had dressed up as a commoner, escaping the watchful gaze of his mentor, and spending the evening out at the pubs, dancing, drinking and playing. The first of many times.

As he looked over Olyvia's shoulder, he spotted his sister, far off,  teaching a young girl how to dance. Smiling he turned his gaze back to Olyvia. He then launched into the dance with a renewed vigor, letting loose with the vigor of a young stallion, and the grace of a swan, deft footwork that had been trained not only for the dancefloor, but also in the art of the duelist.

He sent Olyvia spinning, holding her hand above her like a spindle, and then carefully catching her once more into his embrace.

""I hope you like it?"", he asked in a seemingly innocent voice.",

Bloodraven had sent this poor man headfirst into possibly one pf the most dangerous realms in Westeros, without so much as *informing* him of what had occurred? She shook it off. ""Well, each house has their own side of the story, and I would say that there have been three major alignments before, after, and during the war."" she began, ""Some will try to supress the truth, but I have done my best to not let that happen.""

""The first side is that of the Peakes, headed by Lord Lorimar himself, and accompanied by the Florents and their vassals. "", she paused a moment, ""Next, there are the Oakhearts and their allies. Last but not least was house Tyrell themselves, the proud Lord Paramounts, to which my own house was aligned, as well as the Serries, Rowans, Ashfords, Footlies and Rhyslings. I believe this will be enough to set the stage.""

Now, she began with a story, ""I was little aware that conflict was brewing before Lorimar Peake slew his first Paramount, Lord Corlys, in armed combat, Lord Serry bore firsthand witness to this, and might be of some help. He claimed that the Ashfords were beholden to him as vassals, something they had not been for years after House Strickland took their place. It took time for this story to filter out into the Reach, but my sister and her Tyrell husband hardly seemed worried, not until word reached her that Corlys's uncle was making a bid for the inheritance. So, she mustered her men, and rode to Highgarden, awaiting the arrival of Lyonel the second from Kings Landing, the new Lord Paramount. When he did, she made sure to inform him on matters, and he launched into an investigation of his brothers death, after arresting his own uncle for the attempt to take the paramouncy. However, Lord Lorimar refused to present himself in Highgarden and cooperate in an investigation of Corlys death. So, battle was joined, the Rowan commander sounded the attack, and was sent reeling in retreat.""

Alayne gave a sigh, ""Not long after, Lorimar brought an army to the gates of my home, promising death to its inhabitants, amongst those, me. Not a single raven survived to fly out, so my sister never knew that Lorimar, instead of facing the Loyalists on the battlefield, had decided on attacking her family instead. Three of us managed to escape, in the dead of night.. But the rest were all slain at Lorimars hand."" she could feel the tears welling up for a moment, but wiped them away, and took a few deep breaths before continuing.

""The some of the smaller houses sent their troops to Starpike, but my sister did not. She had hoped that Lorimar would attempt to settle things peacefully. Little did she know... merely a month after, rumors reached her ear that Horn Hill was taken, and her family slaughtered. So, upon order from the Lord Paramount, she marched her army to Starpike, and joined the siege. It seems that the Rhyslings during this timeperiod burned down all of Starpikes villages, something that will have importance later. Months went by, and an Oakheart army came to Starpike, first it was thought that they had come to support the siege, but they had also rebelled. Most of the other lords surrendered immediately, but my sister had to negotiate, Horn Hill was under occupation. After attaining a guarantee that she would not be hurt, and that Horn Hill would be returned, she demustered her men, everyone but a hundred, whom went back to Horn Hill to ensure its return. Those hundred men are the very same that followed me from Kings Landing. So, the Peake assaulted Highgarden, the very center of our fair Reach, and at the point of the sword, the Paramount was forced to abdicate, his young son would rule, but he was yet a minor. So, a triumvirate was announced, a hightower, Lorimar himself, and  Addam Tyrell, representing both house Tyrell, and Oakheart.""

Deaths that should have been mourned years ago, months with little sleep, and the loneliness and intrigue of Highgarden and the Royal court taking their toll. The recent vote was merely the droplet that had filled the goblet to the brim, ready to spill.


First, the Lady merely nodded. The Tyrells had been at the center of all that had befallen her family, her house, her sister. They had taken her sister away, forced her marriage, and returned a curbed dog. Brainwashed, but her sister all the same. She had loved Ellyn all the same, and for a while even been thankful to the Tyrells, bringing peace back. When they had called, her sister had dutifully come to fight their war, and died for them, accursed as a traitor. The new Paramount was hardly any more promising, a foolhardy hothead.

She had clenched her fists so hard behind her back that the knuckles had gone white. Amongst the raging battle in her head, one calm voice took tone, the very same that had led her through these many years, tired but still there. ""W-"" she caught herself a little, ""I will make sure to tell him."" she said. 

She released the tension in her hands and let them rest by her sides, she felt a droplet of *Blood* run down her hand and down her index finger from where her nail had broken the skin. It fell to the floor.

The calmer voice said to the others that at the very least, the Tyrells had voted for her in the hearing. *'Blood'*, the reply came within her, *'Blood of the Oak'*. A quite cynical thought.

He wrapped his arm around Rhaenys and his face brightened a little. When she leaned against him, he let her head nestle in between his head and shoulder.

They too had been rebels, but amongst all the great houses of the mainland, they had been the most neutral.

From without, Alayne seemed strange, her manner seemed quite unlike how she had handled herself at the council. Her body language was stiff and her eyes seemed dull somehow, almost as if the light of passion and emotion had left them. Although she was not even thirty, it made her look far older.

The Lady made her way over to Soraya and took a seat, ""Mm, I want to extend the gratefulness of Lord Damon on behalf of our house..."", her voice trailed off a little, almost as if she had forgotten what she was saying, before catching up again, ""Your house has always been a voice of stability and ration within the Reach, something our realm needs dearly.

According to Alayne  herself, the previous night she was in her quarters after eating in the company of Eddard Hutchesson (her commander of guard), poring over documents and then going to sleep. Her two bodyguards that were supposedly standing guard outside her chambers for the night shift confirm this Alibi when asked, but note that there was a loud noise sometime before midnight, like a crash. 

Upon closer inspection of her guards, her quarters, and herself a few things turn up.

Her hands are remarkably soft, she seems to have been quite liberated from manual work and weapon-wielding, at least during her recent life. Her right hand has a callus on the middle finger, consistent with liberal use of a quill. Her left hand has a small cut-wound in the palm that has scabbed over, likely inflicted by a nail, a shard of glass or something similar.

The lady does seem to wear a dagger at times.

A few notable things turn up in her quarters. An empty bottle of wine, as well as some glass shards, maybe from another bottle. There seem to be red stains on some of the documents on her desk, blood, wine, who knows?

Her bodyguards have calloused hands, consistent with long time use of weapons, one of them has a broken knuckle, but it looks like it happened a long time ago.

The point I'm in in life I'd probably say I'm quite successful, but can't help but feel inadequate, and I'm probably depressed. There's so much I'd like to do, to change, but alas I am but me, and to be honest, I'm not that driven a person. 

What I feel does matter though is what you bring to the world and what you leave behind. The small things, and the big. So my advice? Enjoy the world, enjoy your family, take care of them. Each and every one of us is a miracle of chance, luck, misfortune and kindness. If each and every one of us changes the world just a little for the better - that's a whole lot of goodness. All in all, we are slowly, but surely getting there.

So give your family an extra big hug, just because you can, and good luck out there in the world :)",

*Your name, or your blood?*, the question rang in her ears. 

First, she looked to Alayne, and then back at the Osgrey man, a low, but clear voice suddenly heard, ""Neither"", the reply came, ""I just want this all to end. They never cared about me before, never looked at me, why should they now?"", she blinked, ""Why can't I just leave them all, and go someplace else?"", she asked. Her face was beautiful, but it had something sad over it, lonely maybe. It was quite clear she hadn't really been listening to them, but was quite aware what was happening.",

As for punishment of soldiers for killing innocents (whether on purpose or not), I doubt many would be prosecuted criminally, but would rather face a military punishment, considering that most often not even police officers are criminally persecuted for killing innocents (even less so soldiers).

There are a few fundamental problems in the US, prime amongst them being first past the post, and not just on one level, but on multiple levels! This leads to voting for the alternative most likely to win over your least favorite candidate. Using Instant runoff voting would really help this problem. Add to this that politicians have to fund their own election campaigns either from personal funds, donations, or lobbyists, and you have a recipe for disaster.

The second issue is the current form of debate in media. Generally, people don't have the time or will to properly educate themselves on what candidates stand for, and this definitely isn't helped by the mass media catering to this, trying to give a black and white of ""Right and wrong"" in under ten minutes, as well as the fact that there are only two major candidates to choose from in the final race.

Third: A lack of education, something very common in many countries is that many lack the information they need to make an educated choice. Add to this that many lack the time or will to engage themselves in the political debate, and you get a very complacent voting crowd, where the most important factor is not actually *winning* votes, but getting your voters to actually go and vote.

Also, care to clarify on ""The religion of white""? It has always bothered me how hung up on ethnicity everyone is, when the larger differences are in level of education, level of religiosity, rural vs urban, age etc.",

""We were just about to leave Horn Hill to Oldtown, for Alayne to travel by sea to the Shields, and for discussing a betrothal to the Hightowers for myself. That was when the Florents layed siege, without a word of explanation or attempts at negotiation. It was only after the Fossoways arrived, due to our calls for aid that they made a semblance of negotiations, demanding Lady Alayne as well as money, and rights to patrol men within my lands. I accepted this, provided that the Lady would come to no harm, and that the siege would come to an end, but heard nothing back. I'm sure the Fossoway commander would be willing to confirm this.""

""As for these accusations, some are truths twisted, and others are outright lies. While I was still in Kings Landing, I recieved word from my commander here in Horn Hill that the treasury, as well as our ancestral sword had been stolen by the Florents as they left the castle, in addition to the fact that they have executed several members of my house, most notably mine own father and brother. So, I gave him the authority to set up patrols in my lands to safeguard it, as well as to act if either houses Florent or Peake intruded upon the lands given their criminal past. Indeed, this authority was extended to the patrol commanders. You would likely find the castle treasury already stolen by the Florents if you investigated it. This isn't the first time that they have broken the Peace and resorted to thievery.""

He continued, ""I later recieved word that an army of Florent men passing through my lands had threatened my men, and Ser Edric increased the men on patrol so that they could defend themselves if attacked. The exact events would only be known by the commander on site, but it is not unlikely that the Florents would have been denied passage if they continued to threaten the men and acting unlawfully, as the patrols had authority to do so. As for all others, they would be allowed to pass freely.""

Damon sighed, ""Later during the siege, the Osgrey Commander came forth with prisoners, claiming that they had attacked him and his men, and that they were either brigands, or I had ordered them to do so. Truthfully, I told him that no men of my house had orders to do so, and thus, either the men were not of my house, or his claims of having been assaulted were false. Given that his men vastly outnumbered any of my patrols, the latter seemed far more likely. Once more, the commander of that particular patrol could probably give more insight.""

""As for the last charge, I did indeed attempt to escape Horn Hill with my family, and a group of archers was sent to make a fire as a distraction, not to increase hostilities. This was when negotiations had broken down, and the Florents had refused our surrender. Indeed, my fate would have been that of the men inside the castle had we not attempted to escape. Death by starvation. Given how the Florents have previously executed members of my house, I should likely count myself lucky that it was the Osgreys that apprehended us. This was a matter of survival."", he moved to scratch himself on the chin, but realized that his left hand was no more, and gave up the effort, the elbow stump returning to resting at his side.


He looked at the Osgrey commander for a moment, once more asking himself what his house would gain from all this, before looking back at Marlo. ""I'm sure you will find the truth in all this, Lord Justiciar, solve the puzzle of why it seems the cat attacked the lion.""",

Age, religion and education are far better indicators of what someone will vote for. In fact, for the 2016 election, the party affiliation of ""white people"", the GOP (33%) only held a 7 point lead over the  DNC (26%), with the majority considering themselves independent (37%). Age and education were far better indicators on someones party affiliation, millenials preferring the DNC by a whopping 18 points, and people with a graduation level of highschool or less preferring the GOP by 23 points. Similarly, urban voters (by 23 points) and religiously unaffiliated (by 29 points) prefer the DNC.

So, while being ""non-white"" is a good indicator for being democratic, being ""white"" isn't a particularly good indicator for voting republican.

Now, with a two party system, this wouldn't have been possible, and the politicians could've continued ignoring the question, which I think is what has happened in the US, but with a larger amount of issues.

So, try to tone down the drugs, fix yourself up and get a job, or go to rehab. 

You should probably also urgently go to a hospital to get your wound checked out so it doesn't get infected, and to make sure that the surgery wasn't conducted in an unsafe manner.

Lobbyism - Money has free reign to influence the politicians, which means that regardless of whether one candidate/party or the other wins, they will cater to the big companies, the difference is just which ones.

First Past the Post, on two levels - First past the post is notorious for resulting in a two party, two candidate system, which in turn results in people becoming rather disinterested in politics, the main battle becoming getting your voters to go to the voting booths rather than satisfying the largest amount of people.

While you didn't make any specific suggestions, merely citing ""renewables"" as the solution, I took the liberty of bringing up some of the issues that would need to be resolved before we can transition to a society mostly run on renewables.

In Denmark, a nation having previously been very pro-wind, [resistance is mounting within local populations](https://www.masterresource.org/uncategorized/wind-news-update-denmarks-anti-wind-problem/), common issues being noise pollution and related health problems.

Add to this the fact that [old turbines are now reaching end of life, and another issue arises](https://www.politico.eu/article/small-old-wind-towers-make-for-big-new-problems/). The waste management, specifically of the rotors, which are built from fiber glass. This is notoriously hard to recycle, and can generate enviromentally dangerous particles if left unattended. Hopefully however, a reliable method could be found relatively soon.

[Solar power](https://www.greenmatch.co.uk/blog/2014/08/5-advantages-and-5-disadvantages-of-solar-energy) may seem very clean, and they are once mounted. However, the production of solar panels is both costly and associated with hazardous waste. Added to this, they take a lot of space.

Next comes probably the biggest issue with renewables. [Energy instability](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/germanys-green-energy-destabilizing-electric-grids/) that can cause large amounts of damage to industries and power grids on small timeframes unless fast action energy buffers are built, and cause the need for backup energy production as seasonal fluctuations are far greater. Otherwise, you'd have to import energy from other nations using other methods of electricity production.

But, I hear you say, the solution is simple! Just build batteries! And while I wish that was the case, sadly it is not. The costs of such batteries are immense, and their [enviromental impact](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/11/battery-batteries-electric-cars-carbon-sustainable-power-energy/) great, both in energy cost to produce, hazardous materials, as well as local enviroments endangered to mine rare earth minerals. 

All hope is however not lost. Larger energy storages, such as the [Dinorwig power station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinorwig_Power_Station) are possible without resorting to enviromentally hazardous batteries. Hydropower ""batteries"" such as this one are capable of storing immense amounts of power, loading up water when there is excess electricity and generating when there is a lack of energy. Such megaprojects do however cost hundreds of millions of (€/$/£) and take many years to complete. In addition to this, they have efficiency losses, meaning that each time power is stored or drained some is lost. 

So, while I look forward to a point in the future where we *can* run entirely on renewables, they will probably have to remain auxiliary for now. Right now, we have to invest in a power source certain to solve the problem, and that power source is fission.",

Her mind wandered to the two things that her brother had given her before they left home. She had kept them hidden away as best she could, and the servants hadn't found them. 

Thinking of them made her mind speed through time, long ago, men slaughtered, the watchful eyes of the Peakes and Florents, coffers emptied, armies marching, hunger, and finally freedom. Cut short by a single man and his men, slicing off the arm of her brother, blood gushing from the stump as his scream pierced the night. Poor Damon. Then, her sister had come speaking of peace even in the face of death. So bravely that even as Harrold had attacked her and the knights that had defended her she had tried to bring an end to the fighting, but to no avail. She could still remember the faces of the dead, the Osgrey camp turned into a bloody battleground of huntsmen and lions,  while the people she had grown up with slowly and painfully starved to death inside her home.

As the thoughts had run through her mind, she had clenched her hands without even thinking.

Would it not just have been easier if she too had died like the rest? Then she would be with father and Leo, Ellyn and nana, Rolley and old Eddard, all already gone, waiting for her. Maybe even Damon and Alayne were too.

Milk of the poppy had reduced his pain, but once the infection resided and they arrived to Standfast, the wound had healed. 

While in noble quarters, Damon had oft resorted to reading while the maester was not around, and after a while got used to having merely a stump of an arm. Somewhere in his mind, he had hoped to be ransomed, or released, but those hopes were slim, particularly after he saw what had happened when his elder sister had come to negotiate with the Osgreys.

When the maesters visits stopped, and Damon was moved, he knew that something was wrong, he was still a noble, but the days dragged on, and nothing happened. As time went on, servants would find him mumbling to himself. He would request books to read, to occupy his mind, and distract it at least a little. 

In the first year, he had attempted to escape - twice, though his lack of an arm and bad physique put an end to them swiftly, and soon he stopped trying.

As the years passed on, all hope disappeared of him ever getting released. In the beginning, he had trained to keep his muscles in shape, but as time went on those became few and far in between as his previously rather toned shapes disappeared. Though he had been rather skinny even before, servants would often remark upon him as 'the bone pile'. 

It was after about two years that servants found him passed out one morning, having attempted to strangle himself with his bedsheets, and another month after that he had stabbed himself in the gut with a food knife, leaving blood all over the floor. Though it was not enough to kill him, the wound would first become infected, and then leave a rather nasty scar. Soon, he was eating soup with a spoon and sleeping in the cold without sheets.

After five years, very little remained of the once proud man that had accepted Harrold's challenge. He would merely sit in his chair, in the small area that the light shone upon, sometimes trembling a little or mumbling to himself in the large beard that had grown out over the years. He did seem to be rather alert when the servants brought him food, and would ask about the going ons inside and outside the castle.

She had not recognized him from his voice, since they had met each other very few times over the years. It took a few moments to process the words that had been spoken. 

When the man spoke of Harrold, a rather strange feeling arose in her. In many ways, she hated him, but over the years, she had, in a strange way, gotten to know him. While one part of her wanted to see the kinder man that she now saw, there was always the darker voice, reminding of the pain that had been caused, of the old wounds that never quite seemed to heal.

In truth, she was a bird, yearning for freedom in a cage of gold. Yet, even with the golden bars, she could not help but yearn to spread her wings.

When the Osgrey Lord admired the painting, Cecilia could not help but smile. ""I had help"", she said, ""Standfast is a beautiful castle.""

Then, she rose from her chair, ""Thank you, I am coming, Lord Magnus"", she replied, giving a small curtsy before trailing after him.

---

When the door swung open to Damons room, Cecilia had not quite known what to expect, but even so, she could feel her heart sink. The once clean shaven man that had been her brother now had a long, unkempt beard, the useless elbow stump of a left arm leaving a hanging sleeve.

She could feel the tears well up in her eyes as she entered the room, the door shutting behind her, separating the imprisoned siblings from their guards.

---

A long time went before the door opened, and it wasn't to leave, but a simple request for something to drink. It took longer still after this until Cecilia finally left her brother, though when she did so, she was sobbing no longer.

In practice though, it is often disregarded or circumvented. During the height of the immigrant crisis (2014) tens of thousands (or hundreds I'm not sure) walked across Europe to reach the nations with the most friendly legislations (Germany, Sweden etc.).

The main problem with this convention was that people would start throwing away their passports so they couldn't be identified and thus seek asylum in multiple nations after having been turned away, which in turn in later years led to fingerprinting as ID for asylum seekers in sone countries.

So, back to the US. The refugees would be illegal immigrants as soon as they passed a border without going through the proper checks & visas etc. So many of these people were illegal immigrants even in Mexico. The proper way to go about it would be to enter each country through the passport controls with the proper paperwork etc. and apply for asylum once they arrived in the US. The most common way become an illegal immigrate though is by overstaying a travel Visa after entering the US legally. 

So, to answer your question, if they entered Mexico legally and then entered the US legally, no problems (apart from the risk of being denied asylum). For those that did so illegally, they would be illegal immigrants as soon as they entered the first country illegally. It isn't the travelling itself that is illegal, it just depends on how it is done.",

I'm applying to become a quick mod. From the type of work that each group does, I prefer the discussion mods workload, but given the amount of time I can dedicate to moderation, quick mod duty is better suited.

Why do you want to moderate Seven Kingdoms? I want to moderate 7K because I enjoy the community, and given the strain on the mod team currently I'd like to help out with what I can. What can you bring to the team? I have the occasional spare time, so I can help out with minor things needing doing, maybe a few hours a week tops.

How would you evaluate your knowledge of SevenKingdoms mechanics? I'd say it's decent, but if I'm going to moderate I'll read up on the categories I'll be working on a bit more. How do you plan to improve on this? Partly by reading up on the mechanics a little, and after that experiencing them in practice. I find that using knowledge is what establishes it.

How would you handle a particularly tense conflict pertaining to mechanics or rule interpretation. I'll read the rules, voice my interpretation once, and vote according to it. I'd probably let the rest of you handle the arguing, and then act according to the decision made. I'm interested in helping with the workload, not arguing how the game should be run.

How active do you expect to be as a mod? At the very least once a day, but it could be a lot more depending on how much time I have IRL. This is why I opted for quickmod duty since I mightn't always have a lot of time. How much time will you dedicate to doing modwork? A few hours a week most likely.

Which parts of the game do you think need to be tweaked? Given the current strain on the moderators, maybe a page with clear templates for how to submit orders to reduce the mod workload. I don't intend to advocate any mechanics changes until we catch up with what needs doing.

How active do you expect to be as a mod? At the very least once a day, but it could be a lot more depending on how much time I have IRL. This is why I opted for quickmod duty since I mightn't always have a lot of time. How much time will you dedicate to doing modwork? A few hours a week most likely.

Which parts of the game do you think need to be tweaked? Given the current strain on the moderators, maybe a page with clear templates for how to submit orders to reduce the mod workload. I don't intend to advocate any mechanics changes until we catch up with what needs doing.

Have you moderated any other subreddits? Yes, I have moderated on /r/DawnPowers a few years ago.",

I'm applying to become a quick mod. From the type of work that each group does, I prefer the discussion mods workload, but given the amount of time I can dedicate to moderation, quick mod duty is better suited.

Why do you want to moderate Seven Kingdoms? I want to moderate 7K because I enjoy the community, and given the strain on the mod team currently I'd like to help out with what I can. What can you bring to the team? I have the occasional spare time, so I can help out with minor things needing doing, maybe a few hours a week tops.

How would you evaluate your knowledge of SevenKingdoms mechanics? I'd say it's decent, but if I'm going to moderate I'll read up on the categories I'll be working on a bit more. How do you plan to improve on this? Partly by reading up on the mechanics a little, and after that experiencing them in practice. I find that using knowledge is what establishes it.

How would you handle a particularly tense conflict pertaining to mechanics or rule interpretation. I'll read the rules, voice my interpretation once, and vote according to it. I'd probably let the rest of you handle the arguing, and then act according to the decision made. I'm interested in helping with the workload, not arguing how the game should be run.

How active do you expect to be as a mod? At the very least once a day, but it could be a lot more depending on how much time I have IRL. This is why I opted for quickmod duty since I mightn't always have a lot of time. How much time will you dedicate to doing modwork? A few hours a week most likely.

Which parts of the game do you think need to be tweaked? Given the current strain on the moderators, maybe a page with clear templates for how to submit orders to reduce the mod workload. I don't intend to advocate any mechanics changes until we catch up with what needs doing.

Have you moderated any other subreddits? Yes, I have moderated on /r/DawnPowers a few years ago.",

Cecilia Tarly comissions 150 surcoats and shields adorned with her personal sigil (A huntslady holding a paintbrush with a bow resting at her leg in red with a background of green) for the 125 Tarth men in the Evenstar Manse to wear (25 are extras). Apart from this she is preparing a feast local to the city that will have some entertainers (an entire band). [After talking to one of you, they'd basically (mechanically) be identified as Tarth men wearing the modified Tarly surcoat and this is fine by me.]

During the feast a pair of guards in ceremonial armor (full plate, plumed helmets and halberds. Very unwieldy in close combat, but pretty pretty) would be stationed at the gate, the main entrance, to the western wing (the guest wing) of the manse as well as to the feast hall, and two pairs patrolling the manse perimeter. All the ceremonial men are Tarlies.

Entrances to the areas off-limits to the guests (East wing where Cecilia lives and soldiers are currently housed, Cellar and kitchens) would be guarded by pairs of guards in regular attire. (mail, helmet, shield and sword). Each pair of guards here is one Tarly and one Tarth.",

The large painting was a city by the sea, the sun setting above it. Next was a building, tall and proud. Third was a winding road, off into the horizon. Then, a small painting of a castle. Last, but not least was a painting that seemed to be in progress.

During the so-called ""protests"" where tens of thousanss of people attempted to cross the border fence, a few (maybe a hundred or two?) were killed.

Now, people like to say that Palestine is its own state. If this is the case, then attempting to cross the border fence violently and en-masse would commonly be known as ""an act of war"". People get killed when acts of war are comitted.

Lets say that Palestine is de facto a part of Israel. Then, the people in question would be attacking a military establishment within the country, in which case they'd also be justified to use lethal force. 

Now, obviously, it would be optimal that noone at all was killed, especially children, medics and journalists. But, if you go to a protest with people throwing rocks at each other, you might expect to get hit by one. And if you bring your kid to an attack on military forces, I wouldn't be surprised if either of you got shot. 

The fact is that Israel is remarkably good at enforcing peace and order in their occupied territories, with minimal casualties on both sides (they have dropped markedly in recent years, even with spikes accounted for, I can find sauce if you want). Consider Afghanistan for instance, where the democratic government arguably is occupying taliban territory, and dozens of people die *every day*.",

More importantly however, she hates both the Peakes and Florents with unmatched passion. First they forced her to abdicate her Ladyship of Horn Hill and then deposed the heir she negotiated in her stead, proceeding to exiled her from the mainland for crimes she did not commit.

Upon a canvas stand in the center of the room was a huge canvas, a work clearly still in progress. It was so large that the upper corners had been attached with small strings to hooks somewhere above. Enough of the general structure had been finished that the walls of Kings Landing could be made out, a figure upon them, and the shadows of soldiers clashing beneath the walls. Some banners could be made out as well. Peake, Oakheart, Martell, Tully. Cecilia pointed, ""Look, I even fit your banners in."", and sure enough, the checkered Osgrey lion was also flying upon the field of battle. It was strange however, for none of the men upon the field had yet recieved color, giving the image of eerie, almost phantomlike armies, as if the ghosts of the dead had been caught in the paint, eternally fighting in a battle that was already ended.

""I decided that the battle should be immortalized."", she continued, lifting a lock of hair away from her face, paler than it had been when she left Standfast. No doubt from days upon days spent inside, painting as the harsh winter reigned outside.

Here it isn't so much fighting (where both parties arguably are guilty) but rather a case of downright occupation.

[Consequenses of occupation - West bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank#Consequences_of_occupation), wikipedia. Some notable things here is the dumping of waste in Palestine and exploitation of resources, while native companies are almost entirely prohibited from accessing the more valuable resources. Something that *might* be in violation of the Hague regulations. (There is a lot more to be found on this topic)

[""Mowing the lawn"" - Israeli military strategy in Gaza](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263727829_'Mowing_the_Grass'_Israel's_Strategy_for_Protracted_Intractable_Conflict). Following Israels withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, the palestinians on the strip were largely left to their own devices on managing *internal affairs*, while Israel controls the entire border (land sea as well as airspace) and occasionally launches ""lawn cutting operations"" into Gaza strip territory. One could argue that this is far more inhumane than their policy in the West Bank, since they aren't allowing the Hamas leadership there access to global trade to develop their infrastructure and jobs for their people, nor actually enforcing peace in which reconstruction can be initiated. This creates essentially the worlds largest prison with the help of Egypt, where the territory is free for all. Israel has the resources and power to either choose a full occupation (and the responsibilities associated) or allowing them access to the outer world to develop themselves.

[Netanyahu - A public demonstration of bad policy and indecisiveness](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Analysis-Netanyahus-public-demonstration-of-indecisiveness-and-bad-policy-547776). As an occupying power, Israel has a duty to be decisive and firm. After all, it is the lives of the Palestinian people that hang in the balance. Yet, time and time again, the question of Palestine becomes a voters magnet, with indecisive leadership. By remaining indecisive and at a status quo, the suffering of the Palestinian people is needlessly prolonged for the purpose of political gain. Despicable.

---

These are a few of the examples. As a general rule, focus on the bigger picture, and avoid particular incidents. That just devolves into an endless listing of atrocities by either side.

I myself stand on the side of Israel, but with a two-state solution in mind, all in all, the conflict is a very complex situation however, and there are victims and perpetrators on both sides of it.",

>East Jerusalem is Palestinian territory and always has been. Israel's occupation of it changes nothing and nobody on the planet, not a single country recognises otherwise.

Well, this statement is clearly false, given that ""the remainder"" doesn't recognize Palestine as a state.

Now, given the assumption that Palestine is not a state (since it is not recognized by *everyone* (as per your statement) we also find that [Egypt has renounced all claims to the Gaza Strip, and Jordan has renounced all claims to the West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders_of_Israel#Borders_with_Palestine), this leads to a conundrum. There is no de jure owner of those territories. Now instead the question becomes: Who *de facto* controls these territories, as noone holds a *de jure* claim to them? Well, Israel has complete military control over the West Bank, and controls the airspace, maritime borders and land borders of the West Bank. This would lead the conclusion that the West Bank (and thus East Jerusalem) is a part of Israel (as they control it), and the territory of Gaza is in a state of anarchy, their borders patrolled by israeli forces.",

Many kings had been ousted from power during and after the first world war. Even the king of Sweden had lost some of his clout within the government. Haakon however had received much influence, yet largely chosen not to use it thus far, famously claiming to also be a King of communists after the last election where the previous prime minister petitioned for him to block the new candidate, Kyrre Grepp.

One matter that does come up though is the prince Olav, within marrying age and still unbetrothed. A union between the Norwegian and Swedish houses would be a symbol of peace and reconciliation. Truly showing that the peoples of Norway and Sweden were brethren. As for the tennis match, Haakon gladly accepts though with a smile asks Gustaf to go easy on him.

Quisling however, seemed unfazed. 

""I do agree"", Quisling replied, ""Preparing by setting a solid ground, and let them lose legitimacy by acting first seems in our best interest. I would however advice against direct intervention by Swedish military, rather through support of loyal Norwegians would such a conflict be won."", he paused a moment, ""I think one of the few things that could unite the Norwegians today would be a real threat to independence. Only Arbeiderpartiet are too blind to see they are bringing it into our midst.""

Here Eyde chirped in, still reeling a little from the earlier shock. If Quisling could ensure that the supplies ended up in the right hands, he could funnel such supplies through Raufoss ASA and the Kongsberg Group ASA in Norway. While cautious on the front of advocating for Swedish intervention, he did note that founding a Scandinavian brotherhood league would relatively easily justify Swedish military ""volunteers"" coming to Norway in the event of tensions.

Andresen however seemed more concerned about his own company than anything else. Any armed conflict would mean death, and destruction, which he wanted to avoid. ""Do you think  it would be possible to convince the Socialdemokraterna to support the moderate branch of Arbeiderpartiet?"", in that way, he thought, conflict could be avoided entirely.",

Largely for political reasons.

[Sorry, the paper is in Swedish, but anyhow]

The study, [""Criminality amongst people born in Sweden and foreign countries""](https://www.bra.se/download/18.cba82f7130f475a2f1800012697/1371914727881/2005_17_brottslighet_bland_personer_fodda_sverige_och_utlandet.pdf) indicates that an individual born outside Sweden is twice as likely to have committed a crime as one with two Swedish parents. Those with one or two foreign parents born in Sweden were 1.5 times as likely to have committed a crime.

They continued by noting that the origin regions with the lowest crime rates were Western Europe, Southeast Asia and North America. North Africa and the Middle East were the origin regions with the highest crime rates. In addition to this, the longer a foreigner had lived in Sweden, the less likely they were to have committed a crime.

So, with this study as a basis, one could draw the conclusion that any massive influx of immigrants, particularly from high-risk regions would lead to a significant increase in crime. 

Between 2007 and 2018 Sweden had an immigration of roughly 1.25 million people, which means that if the real trends followed the crime statistics of this study, that would mean a 37% increase in crime rates during those years. (Not evenly distributed across all crime categories. Immigrants are not as overrepresented in white-collar crime.)

EDIT: Wow, this whole thread got tanked. For context, they were discussing whether immigration and/or religion was a factor in the recent increase in bombings mentioned in the article.",

They would then follow the leads of their hosts. While not entirely unusual, some would note that the Norwegian Prime minister Kyrre Grepp did not match the royal visit with a stately one. Though, that would also mean that the focus of the visit was not state matters.

Meetings like these, whiks also being diplomacy between friendly nations, were unique in a way.

He and prime minister Tawfik had come to Bagdad along the Rutba road, a small military escort with them.

Abdullah was indeed positive to this cooperation, glad that 'Abd al-Ilah and Faisal were finally becoming interested in further cooperation. He also agreed that a common currency would strengthen both their nations. Here there was one question, would the combining of currencies also mean a single central bank (and if so, where should it be located), or sticking with the current system, two central banks.

Apart from this, he went on to suggest a joint airforce, given that Jordan didn't have one, and the recent crippling of the Iraqi airforce down to just six fighters. In addition to this, joint military excercises for their militaries.

>!At last, they came to the topic of foreign policy. Abdullah did mention his intention to negotiate with the Israelis for the annexation of the west bank, and maybe port access for Jordanian shipping. If this became a reality, it could allow for Iraqi oil to be shipped to the west without reliance on neither the Syrians for their ports, or the Egyptians for the Suez. He also noted that if instability continued amongst the Syrians, maybe a joint operation to reinstall a Hashemite monarchy should be discussed. Maybe 'Abd al-Ilah could have his own kingdom by the time Faisal came of age. To the East was Iran, and Abdullah noted the importance of stability in their fellow monarchies.!<",

>1. The displaced civilians of the Palestinian Mandate. They will be allowed a grace period of six months to return to their homes. Any others forfeit their right to return to whichever side of the demarcation line they were initially resident, and any property which they failed to claim. Those in homes displaced by the demarcation line may choose a side. Any Arabs who do not wish to return to the newly formed Israeli state are welcome in the West Bank. (In other words, this would include displaced Israelis wishing to return to the Jordan-occupied areas)

>2. Territorial recognition. The states of Israel and Jordan will annex all territories held by each government, and those territories will henceforth be considered sovereign territory of each nation.

>3. Citizenship. To facilitate rehabilitation of the Palestinian area, the demarcation line will now be considered the international border between Israel and Jordan. After the initial six month period of return, residents on each side will automatically receive citizenship in their respective nations, to prevent stateless individuals.

>4. The City of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the Holy City and should be accessible to all Muslims, Jews and Christians. We therefore propose the following:

>   a. The territory defined by the attached map will be considered the City of Jerusalem, henceforth referred to as ""Jerusalem"". While the territory of each nation is still their sovereign territory, it will for governing purposes be considered a single entity.

>   b. Jerusalem is sacred soil. No armed soldier shall ever set foot in the Holy City, nor fly over it, not even in case of war.

>   c. Jerusalem will be governed by a Council consisting of a mayor elected by the residents, as well as one observer from each sovereign nation holding territory within it, all observers holding the right to veto any decisions made by the Mayor. The Council serves all nations which hold territory within Jerusalem.

>   d. The Council has supreme jurisdiction in Jerusalem, issuing laws, taxing the area and so forth. Jerusalem will issue citizenship, be responsible for policing, security, nurturing and protecting its citizens as well as upholding its prime directives as defined by point 4 and its subpoints. Any funds withdrawn from the autonomy would be done so equally to all the nations it serves, or not at all.

>   e. Jerusalem will be its own transit area, with border controls as decided upon by the Council.

>5. Provided that all points are agreed upon, the signing members recognize the State of Israel as a sovereign nation and this will be considered a peace treaty for all signing nations.",

Thus, Jordan proposes a secondary solution. Israel will pay the full value for all those properties that it confiscates by disallowing the civilians to return to their homes in addition to a minor reparation of 100$ per individual refused (a payment plan can be arranged for this). This will be allocated into a fund to build new housing and infrastructure to take care of those displaced that Israel refuse reentry in Jordan instead. In addition to this, Jordan is uncertain whether its supplies of grain and food natively produced  and through the port of Aqaba are sufficient to supply a population increase almost twofold Jordans own native population (The population of Jordan is 500'000). Therefore it will require the construction of a dual-track railroad between Amman and the port of Tsefat in northern Israel. Jordan would be allowed to transport civilian goods into and out of Jordan via this port and railroad without passing through israeli customs to supply the people of Jordan. Transport of such goods would be handled by Jordanians permitted special access by the Israeli government.

**Name**: Armok

**Epithets**: *God of Blood*, Builder of Worlds, Weaver of Fate, Creator of Chaos, The Supreme One

**Description**: No Mortal has ever layed eyes upon Armok as rage and would consume any feeling creature who was in his presence, and their eyes would run red with blood. But, for you, an unfeeling immortal he can take many shapes. Some see him as a tall, proud creature with a long beard that sits upon a great throne, looking down upon the world. Yet, his being is a duality, for others see him as a huge humanoid made of corpses covered in blood, upon a throne of skulls.

**Personality**: Armok, the God of Blood, is appeased by a general sense of conflict - when the universe becomes too boring it is set on the anvil of creation to be reforged. He usually enjoys watching civilizations grow, because he hopes that one day these civilizations will fight each other, and thus generate conflict and slaughter. The ways in which Armok acts to bring about that which he so much desires is seldom understood by mere mortals, but be certain that all his actions have a singular goal even if the path towards it is ineffable.

You can either see the production as the problem, or the waste as the problem. I see the waste as the problem.

There is a finite total amount of resources on earth, but there is access to an amount of energy that with time can become nigh infinite [this is a whole discussion in and of itself but not now, but the energy problem can be solved right now too.].

The world population will reach a peak and is in other words also finite.

Currently, production wastes resources to save energy. At a long term perspective, we want to switch those. Waste energy, conserve resources. Right now we use open ended processes, and often produce items without recycling in mind. If we can close those processes, and make sure that everything we produce is produced in a manner that is recyclable, we can sustain a significantly larger population, for an incredibly extended time. Hopefully, an incredibly extended time would be enough for us to start collecting resources elsewhere than our planet.",

1. *The cost of refugees*: While controlled worker immigration is a net positive in the long run, since the individual would immediately start contributing to the welfare state, importing low-skill immigrants into a welfare state like Sweden has *tremendous* costs. The [net-cost of a refugee during their first year in Sweden](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nationalekonomi.se/sites/default/files/NEFfiler/45-2-lamh.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjolsnls47oAhUwmIsKHWpwBwgQFjAEegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw1xJWJ8GZhq-0XhQqoLJG_x) (This article is in Swedish, but the estimation is there) is roughly 190'000SEK or 19'000USD. 

2. *Refugees getting employed*: Studies were made on statistics from refugees coming to Sweden in '97-'01. This group entered into a properly functioning system, learning Swedish and getting educated. Of their first 15 years in the country (age groups 18-49) they'd get income from an employment for about half of that time collectively, and the other half supplied by the state in various fashion (on average). ([source](https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/artiklar/2019/sa-forsorjde-sig-flyktingar-de-15-forsta-aren-i-sverige/), also in Swedish, check the graph furthest down). The problem is that the great refugee crisis 2014-2018 basically collapsed the system, but optimistically this would mean that the working age adults among the ~500k refugees Sweden has received so far will be working for a living 50% of the time until 2030.

3. *The Swedish Economy*: The Swedish economy and welfare state was not healthy, even before the refugee crisis. We narrowly avoided the housing crash of '08, but this also meant that housing prices never dropped. There was a notable shortage of housing back then with many restrictions on new construction and much of the housing is aging, predominantly having been constructed in the 60's and 70's.   The economy is hardly growing and the Swedish Krona is has dropped some 30% in value compared to the dollar. Combine this with a regressing welfare state and an aging population. Tax pressure is high on manpower, this has expediated the removal of low skill jobs. 

4. *Refugees Welcome - the foundations are cracking*: In 2015, Sweden opened its arms to all refugees. ""We will not count a single cent on what people cost."", a politician stated. That was true, they didn't count and that led to disaster. Tens of thousands of people were coming every week and the entire government mobilized billions of krona. Hotels were leased as housing quite literally ran out. Only barely a quarter of a year later they were forced to dam the flood with border controls towards the Schengen-area. While it took several years for restrictions to grow tighter, a major problem is at hand. They had, in fact not counted. There aren't enough homes, hospitals, schools, police, teachers etc, and there still aren't. The entire Swedish welfare system is at risk of breaking down. As COVID-19 reached Sweden, our epidemiological expert said not to worry. The Swedish healthcare system has 14'000 ""care-hours"" worth of supplies. That might sound like a lot, but with each patient requiring approx. two weeks hours of care, that's enough for no more than 400 patients. With mothers being forced to give birth in corridors and cars due to overcrowding in hospitals and staff both quitting due to being burned out as well as being laid off due to monetary concerns, yes, I am worried. 

I think you can see that the refugees weren't the cause of these problems, but they were a trigger",

Nuclear power plants are the *only* energy source in which waste disposal and decommisioning is included in general cost calculations. [No, I don't argue against this, but decommisioning costs for renewables are *huge*, and their lifespans are *much* shorter]. [Sauce 1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2018/09/04/innovation-is-making-solar-panels-harder-to-recycle/) [Sauce 2](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/wind/the-cost-of-decommissioning-wind-turbines-is-huge/).

While the wind and solar have an average lifespan of 30 years, some of our nuclear power plants have been running for almost 70, and it [may be possible, and cost-effective to maintain them indefinitely](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-power-plant-aging-reactor-replacement-/) (Especially if Carbon tax becomes a thing.) 

Also, for comparison, the increase in energy production by nuclear between 2016 and 2018 was 100TWh, which is roughly the amount of solar energy China produced in 2017 overall.

While renewables are all fine and dandy, we need reliable, long term energy sources, and the new renewables [can't fit that role yet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/09/05/renewables-threaten-german-economy-energy-supply-mckinsey-warns-in-new-report/) and the problem needs to be solved *now*. (Oh, and those water batteries aren't easy or cheap to build). 

While renewables are the energy sources of the future, nuclear power is the safe, clean and reliable solution to remove fossil fuels from electricity production. Nations like Sweden and France already have (almost entirely) fossil free energy grids thanks to nuclear power. 

Yes, building a nuclear powerplant is a massive and expensive project. Creating a carbon free energy grid will be a massive and expensive project, any way we do it, there's no escaping that. 60% of our global electricity production comes from fossil fuels.

I'd argue that if we decide to mass produce nuclear reactors, prices will drop and construction times as well, as the field is standardized.

But, even if that doesn't happen, I prefer a surefire solution that hits in 2035, than a half-assed one that won't get finished until 2100.

Anyways, the most important thing of all is that we *solve this fucking problem*, and we need to start working on that solution yesterday.

All this subject to Jordanian law, meaning that they can be delayed in beurocracy. All that would be perfectly legal. Restricting the access of the pilots to their aircraft would be shady, but not illegal per se.

So, as refugees are moving back to their homes in liberated Palestine, resources previously allocated in Jordan (inc. the West Bank) are now used to help them in their old homes as reconstruction slowly commences. The construction industry has had a huge boom in Jordan over the last eight years, constructing massive amounts of homes.

* House Hightower of Oldtown

* House Osgrey of Coldmoat

* House Mertyns of the Mistwood

Why do you want this claim (what inspires you about it)? 

The Hightowers of Oldtown have fascinated me for a long time, ever since the ITP days in fact. The history of the house and Oldtown is significant to the entirety of Westeros. The Hightower is a symbol of stability in the midst of the chaos of the world of Ice and Fire. The century of blood will bring Westeros through arguably one of its most chaotic periods and Oldtown shall be a beacon of hope in the darkness. Oldtown is also the intellectual center of Westeros, housing the Citadel and the Faith in a time when their dominion is yet unrivalled by any feudal lords. 

House Osgrey of Coldmoat is my second choice. At the beginning of the century of blood we find them at the peak of their power, reigning over the Northmarch from their bastion in Coldmoat. The might of the Osgreys has risen alongside their Gardener overlords, but will their good fortunes remain? Where Oldtown finds its power in commerce and learning, the powerbase of the Osgreys stands on the might of their soldiers.

Honestly, the reason I chose the Mertyns of the Mistwood as my third application is to have a smaller claim to settle with in case both Oldtown and Coldmoat go to other players. I expect to be in the company of a few players I already know and a large part of inspiration for roleplay is just that. House Mertyns is proud and old house, laying claim to the valyrian bastard sword Silver Mist. Just like the Owl on their sigil, they are patient and honorable. Alongside their Estermont liege, they will surely accomplish things worthy of song and praise.

What would you bring to your claim?

I love creating characters, building the story around them and seeing that grow and evolve into its own thing. I've Rp'd powers, characters and countries for several years now and I tend to get attached to the claims I play, getting stuck in for the long haul. 

So, stability, flavour, character depth and long-term player to player roleplaying is what I bring. It is also the reason that I have opted not to apply for the royal houses, since their far larger scopes aren't as conducive to the type of Rp I enjoy and am good at.

Do you plan to co-claim?

I was not planning on running a co-claim, but would happily run as a duo in Oldtown or Coldmoat if there are others interested.

Sample Rp:

In the thoughts of Lord Mertyn **Hightower**


> *The King calls upon me to ride by his side, to send my men into battle against the Dragons. The High Septon on the other hand says to stay the men, to keep them within the City. No, not even the might of stone can keep those flying beasts at bay. Someone will have to tame them, and it will be me, but it is the Word, not the Sword that tames the Dragon. We will welcome Aegon as we would our own King. I, Lord Martyn Hightower, shall kneel before the King, but even the King kneels to the High Septon and listens when the Maesters speak. The People, Power and Prosperity of Oldtown and the Hightower will prevail where Kings and Armies have fallen.*

---

Lord Perwyn **Osgrey**, mustering his men

>""Soldiers of the Northmarch!"", Lord Perwyn Osgrey called out, ""King Mern has called upon us to defend  our home, the Reach against the Beasts from across the sea. We are the shields of the Realm, we will defend it and we will strike the invaders *down*.""

>The sun gleamed in the armor of the assembled soldiers, the checkered Osgrey lion adorning many of the shields. Amongst them he also saw Rowans and Roxtons, men who were willing to die for him, just as he was willing to die for his King. Soon they would depart from beneath the walls of Coldmoat to Goldengrove, where the largest army that the world had ever seen was assembling to thwart the Targaryen menace once and for all.

Lord **Mertyn**, mulling over news in his Solar

>Lord Mertyn stood in his solar in the Tower of Owls, looking out across his lands. Far below him people were milling about, tending to fields, children playing. It was all so calm and serene. Word had come from his Lord in Estermont, the men were being mustered to war. He sighed.

>He just hoped that his people would be safe, that his men could return home once this was all over. He turned around and saw his daughter running towards him, blissfully unaware. For a moment, all was forgotten as he lifted her into his arms, ""I love you too"", he said to her, smiling.",

>Economic integration between the future Jordanian Provincial Gov:t and her Citizens in Palestine. This includes Jordanian citizens resident in Palestine paying taxes to the Jordanian government rather than the Palestinian and adhere to Jordanian economic law. The Jordanian government will in turn either directly provide for their welfare and social welfare of pay for those costs to the Palestinian government. They would also be eligible for Jordanian social benefits should they choose to pay taxes to Jordan. They would also be exempt from any travel fees or visa rules between when travelling between Palestine and Jordan Dual citizens would be allowed to choose which government they participate in.

>The Palestinian Province will pay taxes to Palestine as they are in Palestine, not Jordan. Instead, we will agree for a voluntary premium to be paid by Palestinian subjects should they seek to obtain Jordanian-specific social benefit programs. Palestine is rebuilding its nation and it requires as much tax income as it can get. Furthermore, the objective of the union is to eliminate all trade barriers and visa rules as it will become one nation. Naturally there will be economic benefits for Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation which are common to the entire Union.

This includes the time up to the declaration of Union. Jordan is, as said willing to provide money to Palestine for their reconstruction efforts, and in fact already are providing roughly 50USD million in aid to Palestine in addition to massive voluntary efforts on behalf of Jordanian companies. With this provision in place it would allow us to begin providing services to Palestinians right away, which Palestine cannot. Since they will be allowed to choose which to participate in, we expect that participation in Palestinian services will increase greatly once there is a proper system to participate in. If we are to start constructing schools and hospitals that our people require, we need to know we can levy the taxes to pay for them in the future.

>Political integration between the future Jordanian Provincial Gov:t and her Citizens in Palestine. This would allow Jordanian residents in Palestine to vote in the Jordanian federal and provincial elections. Dual citizens would be allowed to vote in both. It would also mean that Jordanian political parties are free to operate in Palestine (according to Palestinian law)

>There will only be one Arab Citizenship following the union. Provincial elections should be based off of residency rather than jus sanguini.

This has not been specified in the declaration of the Union. Hence, Jordan expects to continue to issue legal documents for all her citizens. This also allows the Jordanian people to continue to participate in their politics, as it is their right to do. This is why this article is included.

>Judicial integration:...

At the very least all Jordanian people and legal entities must have the right to ask for a trial in a Jordanian court of Law, according to Palestinian law.

>The Arab League and Palestinian people outside of the West Bank recognize the All Palestine Government as legitimate. We maintain our recognition of Jordanian sovereignty over the West Bank and the Jordanian King's titles over these lands.

This is not regarding the wishes of the Arab League, it is in regards to Jordanian citizens that at the wishes of Egypt have been returned to their former homes in Palestine. In other words, we are asking this on behalf of the Palestinian people. 

An alternative would be to hold a three-option referendum in Palestine as to whether they would have an Egyptian, a Jordanian monarch or none at all.",

It would also mean that Jordanian political parties are free to operate in Palestine (according to Palestinian law)

* Economic integration between the future Jordanian Provincial Gov:t and Jordanian companies operating in Palestine. This includes Jordanian legal entities operating in Palestine paying taxes to Jordan rather than the Palestinian gov:t. They would be entitled to Jordanian benefits and economic law. Transport of goods between  Jordan and Palestine would be exempt from cargo rules and fees.

* Judicial integration between the future Jordanian Provincial Gov:t and Jordanian legal entities in Palestine. Any legal entities created by Jordanian citizens and legal entities in Palestine would be considered Jordanian legal entities. Jordanian citizens and legal entities acting in Palestine have the right to be tried in a Jordanian court of law if they so wish (according to Palestinian law except on economic matters).

* Any changes to these provisions would have to be agreed upon by both the Palestinian and Jordanian governments on a provincial level.

* A majority of the people of the Palestinian people (approx 1.2 million people including the West Bank, 700'000 excluding the West Bank as of this agreement) recognize the monarch of Jordan as the monarch of Palestine (including all territories within this region). As of this agreement the Jordanian monarch relinquishes the title as King of Palestine to the Egyptian Monarch and the claims of Jordan to all territy held by the State of Palestine on behalf of the Jordanian People. A breach of any clause included in the Bill of Rights would annull this statement if the Jordanian Monarch so chooses.",

Me for instance, I live a quarter of a world away, know american history and know some of these people as heroes of *their* time. They enabled change for the better, despite their flaws. That is something to strive for - something to look up to. We all have flaws, but also the ability to change things.

Over time - yes, they have become glorified, as legends do, but that legend also stands for something, it motivates people to do better, to work for change in their *own* time. They are remembered for the good thing or things that they did, and the name and statue becomes a face for that good thing.

So, it makes me sad when a movement where the initial intention was good becomes warped and corrupted. Riots, vandalism, destruction. These are things I am against. A few people long ago built these statues, put love and heart into them, over time, many others have diligently cared for them, to make sure that they stand today, so that others can see them, and over time millions of people have seen them, some may even have been inspired.

I suppose this is just a big wall of text, but

TL;DR

For many, statues like Grants represent good things. It sucks to have good things torn down, and people dislike those who tear down what they think is good.",

While house Penrose owned neither gems, ancient swords nor crowns of great kings long gone, the library in the tower of the parchments held many books, both new and old. One of them however stood out from the rest. It was a huge, old leather bound tome, many pages seemed to have been rebound from other, older books, fragile to the touch, others were new and blank, having yet to be filled with ink.

Whence the book had come originally, likely noone knew, the first pages probably from some old maesters book bought by a far flung ancestor. The tale that was told in it however was that every Penrose since a long gone Ser Pen had continued to expand the book. As they learned new things, they added chapters in to the best of their abilities.

Notably, the first coherent chapter speaks of the beginning Andal Invasion, even though the story concerning the creation of the book was set almost three thousand years later after the beginning of the andal invasion.

>*King Cleoden I Durrandon of the Storm, fifth year*

>I have come to the realization that Penroses to come would have much to gain by learning  the lessons of their own forebears, and those which history have taught us. It is therefore that this book will be writ by myself and you who readeth my book, no, our book after me. This is also the reason that I have placed the story of this book at the beginning, for this is where the tale it tells begins and arguably the most important lesson it teaches. Learn from the past, and teach those who come after you of what you know.

>-*Ser Pen*

[M] Opt in to random rolls, mechanical benefit would be allowing characters knowledge of past events (with rolls for events far back maybe to determine the accuracy of the book), and maybe some kind of skill bonus (1 level of econ?).

They do agree that commercial shipping rights should be established for all members.

Given [Finland](/u/TheKillerSloth)s uneasiness in joining the agreement, they may be a partial member through a special clause, so as to not jeopardize the integrity of the trade bubble. Only Finnish-produced goods would have reduced tariffs when exported to the other Nordic countries, to prevent Mitteleuropa goods from circumventing the tariff threshold through them. They would be invited as full members once they enact the same economic policies.

The US is however not the most violent country on earth, there are worse. That said, the american police system needs to be reworked, probably with a proper education rather than a short training program. Affirmative action is only a temporary band-aid, as while it might help with the symptoms of the problem, it doesn't tackle the cause.

What would be needed is to increase general socioeconomic mobility in the US (rn people born poor generally stay poor and vice versa for rich folks). The current lack of socioeconomic mobility leads to a group that has been oppressed (african-americans for instance) and other groups that start off poor (illegal and legal immigrants, refugees) staying poor.

Methods of fixing that are improved free education (improvements in public schools, colleges and making university education free). There needs to be some kind of basic health insurance, improved adult skills training programs and rehabilitation for convicted offenders.

(The american justice system is also broke and needs fixing btw for proper equality, but that could be a whole own wall'o'text)

These are, in essence, tools that provide equality of opportunity , which is the permanent solution to racial inequality. 

As for racial bias amongst the people... That takes a bloody long time to get rid of. In my view it is precent amongst most american people in some shape or form and what I think is necessary to get rid of it is to get rid of the current race-centric view on social issues in the US. That, and a LOT of time, you essentially need to pass like two generations of people (one that gets rid of the current problems and forgets them and one that grows up without them) for it to pass out of the collective mind.

The case that the Swedish minister for finance presents is that the Nordic countries are too reliant on their trade with Germany, as can be seen through the effects that Black Monday has had on the region. In order to promote resilience, it would be more important to have a protected internal Nordic Market, encouraging trade between the nations. While the Germans would undoubtedly have their reservations about this, it would be quite helpful to their own economies.

The proposition is as follows: A sharp reduction in tariffs between the Nordic nations, as to encourage free trade between them, combined with a threshold tariff towards the rest of Mitteleuropa on all goods that are produced within the signing nations. While this would be in violation of the rules stipulated by Germany for Mitteleuropa members, we highly doubt that they would take action against a collective Nordic bloc.",

Unprofitable decisions might then be forced upon us, such a possibility is unacceptable.

Branobel would definitely be interested in constructing the gulf railway. They would also request rights to construct infrastructure such as storage facilities along other Ottoman railway lines as well, where necessary. These would obviously be fully owned by the company, since their purpose would be to support Branobel rail traffic. 

While initial efforts would likely focus on expanding port capacities in the mentioned areas and railways to accommodate the transport of oil through them (ships and trains would be imported from other Branobel facilities), once that has been completed, there efforts could be refocused towards dockyards and train workshops.

As for loans, if the Ottoman Empire wishes to borrow and could not afford the interest in cash, Branobel would be willing to take it in oil, at a discounted rate of course.

Would there be interest in the construction of a refinery as well?

As for the engine, the idea is to use a modified diesel engine intended for a small barge, this would have the horsepower required to move even an armored train, and the development cost would be lower due to reusage of existing blueprints. Estimation at ~100'000$ in development.",

""My old friend, it's been far too long since we last met. I'm growing old, but these bones will last a while yet. Congratulations on your grandson!""

The Norwegian entourage are brought into Drottningholm castle, where they are well received. King Gustaf V tells his Norwegian counterpart about the fact that his grandson, Gustaf Adolf, was appointed Minister of Defence by the most recent government. Apparently he had loved the work, in addition to his rank as Major within the army.

---

Sometime later, when things were calming down, the three of them, King Haakon, King Gustaf, and Gustaf Adolf, or Prince Minister Bernadotte as he was also known took a room for themselves, and sat down to talk. It seemed that it was less the Swedish King talking, and more his grandson.

""We heard that parliament dissolved the State Church, horrific news. I myself thought that the inclusion of the Agrarians in the government when you allowed the Labour party to be appointed would balance things but that doesn't seem to be the case. ""

He hesitated a moment.

""What's next? You *are* the head of the Church of Norway, will they change the constitution *further*?""

There was no question as to what was implied, the Norwegian Monarch held considerable powers - even if they were only a formality. The appointment of government, the dismissal of it, head of the armed forces, the church, the appointment of senior officials, veto of law, the list goes on - the next target might very well be the king himself.

""We've all seen in other countries what happens when syndicalists reign, murder and bloodshed, particularly of the perceived nobility, and what this government is pacing towards seems nothing short of it.""

""Maybe the family could stay here in Stockholm - until things settle  down? The Royal Guards of Norway are loyal to their King, and nothing short of the best, yet even so I feel we should offer additional men, men that can be depended on. It is no secret that the radicals have been purging the officer corps of any ideological dissent. I hope it would never be used, but still.""",

Solar Power produces energy in the daytime and does nothing at night (this gets even worse when you take seasons into account in the far northern and Southern hemispheres). Wind relies on surprisingly fickle air streams for their power generation, and clustering too many together can have adverse and unpredictable effects on their energy production. Overall, this means they can not be relied upon for baseline energy production, and need other sources to shore them up and balance out the energy fluctuations they create in our electric networks.


[You can read more about this problem in this paper here, but my guess is you're ignoring my sources.](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~aiellom/tesi/blegten.pdf)

Currently, the nation in the World that is increasing their renewable output the most is China, and they're increasing their nuclear output even faster. What this can tell you is that while each individual solar or wind Power plant installed is faster, increasing their energy output as a whole takes just as long as nuclear Power - if not longer. [Casualties and damages from nuclear Power are in fact similar or even lower than those  injuries and Deaths caused when installing wind and solar Power.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Energy_accidents&oldid=907702892)

An additional problem is the lifespan of solar panels and wind turbines. Right now that's about thirty years, which means that a country like Denmark that has been investing heavily in wind Power is already  having large problems with their Power production depreciating and with hard-to-recycle waste in the form of glass-fiber wind turbine blades.

The reason for the so called ""decline"" of nuclear Power is the unwillingness of governments to take action and invest in greener solutions than fossil fuels, because fossil fuels are dirt cheap (because they are dirty). *That* is the main competitor to nuclear power, not renewables.

The factoid that we have no solution for nuclear waste is false. There are massive storage facilities where the waste can safely become inert, and already a large amount of the waste is recycled into new fuel for reactors. Reactors running on waste is not far off either.

So, no, there are several fatal flaws with renewables that will take time to solve. They may become a viable solution in the future - and I certainly hope that will be the case, but for now they will have to be relegated to an auxiliary role.

What we need is to start implementing a proper solution *right now*, and nuclear Power is the only viable and reliable option to fossil fuels.

Also, I've noticed you aren't supplying any sources for your statements, so kindly start doing that or our discussion will be at an end. All I see is you spouting anecdotes without any sources to back them up. If I really am wrong, I want to be proved wrong, like I'm doing to you right now.",

Nuclear however is fully capable of that even in its current state. Sure, constructing nuclear power is expensive, but any solution to fossil fuels will be, whether that be future renewables with massive energy storage plants or nuclear power.

The main thing is that nuclear fission is a reliable and known solution capable of replacing fossil fuels as our baseline energy source. Just look at [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France), they have been operating more than 50 reactors for nearly thirty years now without any major incidents. This has allowed their electric grid to be almost entirely free from fossil fuels since the *80's*. The only other nations to be able to do such things are either also using nuclear power, or have access to large amounts of hydropower.

Right now, we need a source of power that we know can replace fossil fuels, and that power source is nuclear fission. Once we've purged fossil fuels from the global energy grid, we can start think ing of developing even better long term solutions such as fusion power or renewables.",

Passive smokers have been shown to take up carbon monoxide and nicotine into their blood stream (between 7-15% of the levels of a heavy smoker). Studies have not yet proven that passively smoking marijuana has similar effects, but logic would dictate it.

 Most signs so far indicate that smoking marijuana does cause lung cancer, and it might in fact be worse than tobacco (per joint/cigarette)

Here are some of the things that  we do know that indicate this to be the case:

* Marijuana smoke contains many of the same harmful substances that tobacco smoke contain, substances tied to lung cancer.


* Studies of lung tissue from regular marijuana smokers have shown similar tissue changes as in tobacco smokers, which are known to signal the future growth of cancer.

Some of the things that are contraindications:

* We do not yet have studies directly tying marijuana smoking to lung cancer. This is due to marijuana being illegal up until very recently, it has been incredibly hard to conduct studies  on the drug. In addition to this, most that smoke the drug are quite young - lung cancer and COPD usually debute at ages 60+. 

* Marijuana smokers  generally smoke fewer joints than a tobacco smoker smokes cigarettes, this lowers each individuals risk of contracting cancer.

Sources (copy and google it and they should be the top result):

* Marijuana and your risk for lung cancer - WebMD

* Absorption of nicotine and carbon monoxide from passive smoking under natural conditions of exposure - M J Jarvis, M A Russell and C Feyerabend


**Conclusion**

No, marijuana is not harmless and you should not expose those who do not wish to be exposed to it, neither should you encourage others to use it. In my humble opinion, it's fine for you to fuck up your own health, but don't claim it to be harmless and get others to do it. Oh, and don't complain when the health complications come - you brought this on yourself.

EDIT: A moments longer searching on NCBI actually turned up a meta-study that had collected information on marijuana health effects. While it deemed that the studies variable in quality and insufficient to determine the exact effects the following quote can be found in the summary.

>Despite these limitations, this review should alert primary care physicians to the potential adverse health outcomes associated with the widespread use and abuse of and dependence on marijuana.

Without doing either, the person in question (including spouses and heirs) can leave freely on their own whims, wander and come back (close relatives and their spouses should probably have a ""call home"" option though, that they could refuse).

Permission to leave would give merely the slightest opinion malus with that courtier upon enabling. However, refusing a request to leave should give a moderate opinion penalty with that courtier and a small opinion penalty with all courtiers (""restrictive liege"" or some such). Refusing a leave request would give them the option to ""plot to escape"" which should be rather easy (it's not like they're under house arrest).

Forbidding someone to leave should give a severe opinion penalty with that courtier and incur a small to moderate tyranny modifier (5 or 10?). This should also right away enable the ""plot to escape"" option.

The desire to plot escape (elope if you will) should mainly be influenced by the courtiers opinion of you and to a lesser degree the court they wish to flee to (low opinions would let them elope into ""wandering"" status). The outcome options for escape should be ""slips into the night"" (gives you no notification at all), ""noticed"" (triggers event chain with several options, say hunt them or whatever) and ""caught"" which would let you put them in house arrest in your court, tell them to stay (which would give them the option to concede or say no, which would force you to choose between house arrest or letting them leave) or let them go.

There should also be a ""promise title"" option to invite courtiers, letting you chose from titles you hold. Doing this would give them a claim on said title should they accept and bring them to your court. You then have a 3 month time window to give them a title. Giving no title would give them ""disappointed"" (severe malus) and cause them to leave, giving a lower tier title would give ""disappointed"" (moderate), giving a same tier but other title would make them happy (but they keep the claim), giving a higher tier title would make them happy (and they lose their claim).",

Given that you live in the western hemisphere (sweden), the average gdppc is about 45k 1995 US$.

So, if you are an average swede you need to reduce your consumption to 1/10th of your current consumption. 

The goal for number of vehicles sets a limit at 10% of the population owning a 4 wheel EV.

So, if you like the degrowth scenario, you can start to help bring it into reality today by reducing your own consumption. You can also help out by ditching your car today, and not buying an EV, since you're likely going to be amongst the 90% without a 4 wheel vehicle.",

The part about Africa ""producing"" slaves even before America is colonized is entirely realistic and correct though, the only difference might be a few new areas starting to produce it (which we do get to some extent when europeans colonise the western half of africa in-game).

Each country'd, CN and TC would have a domestic market, each trade node would be a local market where goods and funds are exchanged. Next you'd have items that are unsupplied, which creates demand - and the demand creates a flow of those goods to connected trade nodes (and beyond). Trade power would then represent a nations control over the trade in a node (ability to prevent trade with nations, place tariffs, etc). Now, you've also created a system where money is given to the pops who produce the goods, and if each province has the ability to produce several goods, it'd slowly trend towards producing the most profitable good currently. (Here we'd also have room for rulers placing laws and regulations).

Yes, eu4 is a war game, but that doesn't mean that eu5 can't have proper economics.

On the brokenness of eu4's eurocentricism - one easy example is to look at tech. It starts with a european advantage - and trends towards global equity. This, combined with how colonization works atm, means that Europe hits its peak colonization in the 1500's, speeds across the americas in a century, and then never touches asia. At least that's been the case in all games where I haven't actively gone to colonise asia.

> Academy training includes classes in firearms, first aid, criminal law, emergency vehicle operations, defensive tactics, physical fitness and report writing.

Notice something?

What's taught to police is useful for identifying crime and handling *escalated situations*. 

Thus:

Education must become longer and focus more on what's useful in general, calm situations, deescalation tactics, psychology etc...

In addition, the profession must become more appealing to the kind of people we want in it (calm, compassionate people).

And guess what, this all costs money, in fact, by removing police funding you'd be exacerbating the problem.",

If you read the article, you'd also see that the vaccine shipment hasn't been blocked, it is merely awaiting political approval (which I hope will be granted swiftly). 

As long as the purpose of the blockade is not to starve the Gazan population, and it does not impede humanitarian aid - it is not a war crime. This is definitely not the case, as Israel actively supplies Gaza with water, electricity and occasionally also medicine. AFAIK, the only things they are interested in blocking are weapons and military supplies.

And yes, as I said, Israel does maintain a 300m buffer zone along its border into Gazan territory, and when Hamas does attack, Israel retaliates against military installations and storage facilities.

I agree that the situation is tragic, though the real culprit is Hamas. They have continued a hopeless war, causing suffering and misery for everybody involved, palestinians and israelis alike. They had a marvellous opportunity when Israel withdrew its ground forces to create a free Gazan state, with the potential to be at least as prosperous as the West Bank, if not more so, given the lack of Israeli soldiers within Gaza proper.",

This move by the de Geer cabinet had had quite the opposite effect in Sweden-Norway to in Denmark. It fermented opinions on the topic, and caused such an outrage that the Minister of State and Justice found his private residence vandalised. This has meant that the pan-scandinavian movement (maintenance of the union, cooperation with Denmark rather than the other western powers) has become intrinsically connected to the conservative movement.

The British did control it, and did try to arrange a peaceful exit, much like they did with India where they split the country into Pakistan and India proper. However, unlike in india, it became apparent that one of the two sides was completely unwilling to come to terms. Their attempt at peace had failed, and so they left.

>And Israel was founded in May 14, 1948. Not revived, not found, nor anything. As a result of its foundation, it had placed over 5 millions of Palestinians in diaspora. That's what matters to me.

Yes, Israel was founded out of the ashes of a civil war, where no clear borders existed. One side of the war was victorious, the other lost. During the war, civilians on both sides fled, and weren't allowed to return. If the Arabs had won, there would likely be as many jews in Jerusalem as there are in Iraq, or Syria, or Egypt. (Almost none)

>Zionists were a foriegn power to the natives of Palestine in that period of time.

Jews have been living in the area since ancient times, it is true that many more had fled there from other parts of the world, bought land and started homes for themselves. They had just as much right to be there as latin american immigrants do in the US. Difference is that the anglo-americans haven't ever (and hopefully never will) started a war to try and throw them out.

>It is complete theft of land and the explusion of 5mil+ Palestinians with no right of return is a complete farce.

>This all is, including land annexing, is against the international war law.

This so called ""theft of land"" has a name, it's called War. The nature of war is that one side wins, and generally claims some kind of territorial prize, the other loses, and suffers the consequences. We can see examples of it on a massive scale just a few years earlier, you may want to read up on ""World War 2"", to get some perspective, other examples include ""World War 1"" and ""The Franco-Prussian War"".

Secondly, the number of Arab civilians displaced was closer to 1 million than 5 and the vast of those will have died of old age by now.

>This all is, including land annexing, is against the international war law.

Might makes right, international law is a farce. How much attention is being given to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine? The number of civilians displaced there is roughly double the number of Arabs that were displaced in the 1948 conflict, yet I hear almost nothing about it in news or on reddit.

>You must understand that as of a leader in that time having gone through years of war, it's pretty hard to say ""yes"" that have half of your country gone.

There had been peace in the area for more over twenty years at that point, and there was no ""your country"". Before the renewed jewish-arab conflict in '48 there hadn't existed an independent state in that area for more than six hundred years, and that state was the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem.

>One Palestinian is murdered by the IDF per day since 2009 according to the IDF statistics.

[Citation needed]

Whilst approximately 4700 Palestinians have been killed due to the conflict since 2009, there have been at least 900 individual days without any casualties during that time period.

>the solution is quite simple: end the occupation.

This ""solution"" has already been tried in Gaza. It did not work, in fact it made things worse for everybody involved, even the Gazans.

This conflict will end when the Palestinian side decides that they are no longer interested in hitting their heads against a brick wall.",

What's your utopia?

The simple fact is that the free market is quite good, it has raised the living standards of all of humanity and I'm quite certain that it'll figure out how to solve the climate problem with a bit of nudging from legislation.

Corruption is a problem that is not inherent to the market economy, and if we look historically, it is far more prevalent in systems that do not utilize market economy.

Profit governs actors within the free market, and when you change the rules so that green options become profitable, the market complies.

The LTV fails due to the fact that the value creation from work is not inherent to the work itself. Just like a stack of metal sheets and bolts individually do not have the value of a boat, the labor of a worker is not worth its product when combined with the tools necessary to complete it, in fact, the product of work (whether that be the functioning shop or a finished shoe) is more worth, excess value is created.

Since you live in a civilized country, the cashier has the choice to not work, which also entirely removes the argument that ""they are forced to work to live"". The worker has the choice to not work, and negotiates (often collectively) to work for a certain value. If they do not want that work, there generally is someone else who does.

A company is a construct, a system (much like an engine or a machine) made up of parts (employees, machines, products, money). The purpose of the system is to create something more valuable than its components (profit). This profit is then either used by the company to expand itself (generally to create even *more* profit) or rewarded to those that own the company. The owners are generally either those who created it (i.e put in the work to build the company/machine), or have bought it from the creator.",

During the 60-70s, the social democrats in Sweden *tried* (and luckily failed)  to move away from the market economy. 

I know less about France, since I don't live there, but it is a common misconception that the Nordic Model (as it is often referred to outside scandinavia) is a form of socialism. What it is is a regulated market economy with universal public welfare systems, heavy taxation on work and a focus on collective bargaining with respect to workers rights.

Our tax rate on corporate profits is 21,4%, which might be surprising to you, because that's exactly the same as in the US.",

However, when protein content is considered that number is 10-30 kgs co2 equivalents/kg protein (poultry) vs 6-17 for vegetable substitute protein.

This relationship gets even closer in countries where farming of vegetable protein is not feasible and instead must be transported long distances, whilst the poultry can be produced locally with agricultural products that can be grown in the area.

However, the important part here is the comparison versus beef, which has a several magnitudes higher carbon footprint per kilo and is responsible for the majority of the impact of the meat industry (9-160kg co2 equivalents per kg beef).",

noun 

the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group.

""a campaign of genocide""

synonyms: racial killing, massacre, wholesale slaughter, mass slaughter, wholesale killing, indiscriminate killing, mass murder, mass homicide, mass destruction, annihilation, extermination, elimination, liquidation, eradication, decimation, butchery, bloodbath, bloodletting, pogrom, ethnic cleansing, holocaust, Shoah, slaying, battue, hecatomb

There are any number of reasons someone might turn you down. Some personal examples are:

* Interested in someone else

* She had a social media addiction

I also have a few friends (current and past) that I wouldn't date (and they probably wouldn't date me) for various reasons:

* Alcohol issues

* Smoker

* Poor choices of previous partners and general promiscuity

* Age

Actors will generally strive to produce the largest amount of excess value within the game rules.

So, if the current game rules result in undesireable behavior, one must change the rules to make said undesireable behavior unprofitable - or at least less profitable than the alternative.

An example of such a rule change is a flat fee per kg of CO2 eq released. Additionally, we want to incentivize change, so let's tie it to inflation and slap on a 5% yearly cumulative increase on said fee.

This produces two problems.

 1 It doesn't affect emissions outside the country - encouraging companies to ""export"" their emissions. Thus, we would need to create a trade union where all members have the same fee. Any goods imported into said trade union gets a fee of suitable size slapped on.

2 The government becomes addicted to the revenue from the CO2 fee. Thus, the usage of the money from the fees must be decided in advance so it isn't abused. One potential use for the revenue would be investments in nuclear power, renewables, recycling and research into enviromental sustainability.",

2. The contents of the Nicosia Treaty in its full text will be confirmed by the Turkish Parliament in Ankara transferred into Turkish law upon its signature. This will allow Turkish lawmakers to update rules and regulations to reflect our changing modern world in the future.

3. Turkey will work to create an avenue for Black Sea and Mediterranean to make suggestions and influence the administration of the straits, with the help of the increased flexibility mentioned in point 2.

4. Special provisions for the USSR:

a. The USSR is allowed the right to exceed the limit of nine foreign warships simultaneously present in the Straits, they are permitted to exceed this limit by at most 5 warships. Clarification: If there are nine warships in the Straits, the USSR shall be allowed to insert another five.

b. Singular Soviet warships passing through the straits shall be allowed up to four destroyer escorts of the same flag, an exception to the two destroyer limit that applies to other Black Sea fleets.
c.  Aircraft carriers are, for the USSR exclusively, considered capital ships. Hence, all regulations and exceptions that apply to Soviet capital ships apply to soviet aircraft carriers.

5. Other alterations:

a. The aggregate tonnage limits are changed as follows:

I. Article 14 - The aggregate tonnage limit is 30,000 tons.

II. Article 18, ( a - aggregate tonnage limit is 60,000 tons.), ( b - shall be increased by the same amount, up to a maximum of 90,000 tonnes), ( d - vessels for humanitarian purposes shall not exceed 16,000 tonnes altogether)

6. Attached is the full text of the Montreux treaty. It is for all intents and purposes part of this treaty.

7. With the signature of this treaty, the Montreux treaty is defunct.

[Here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/france-plans-to-reduce-nuclear-in-favor-of-renewables/) is a better one.

First off, a 50% energy share for nuclear means it will still be the primary energy source. Secondly, here is what enviromentalist Marc Jedliczka said.

>Key will be a reduction in energy demand and improved storage capabilities. The ADEME report paints such a scenario, predicting technical feasibility for a 100 percent renewables system by as early as 2050.

So a 100% renewable system *might* be feasible thirty years into the future if France *reduces* it's electricity need.

We won't be able to reduce our total electricity requirements though, especially if vehicles, heating systems and steel production are going to become electric. We need more electricity production, not less.

What renewables *can* be useful for is as an auxiliary energy source. They provide cheap, unreliable power, which means that their usefulness in a stable system is enabled by load balancing. (Energy storage, baseload, demand side regulation)

Also, this energy transition bill was signed in 2012 by a (shocker)  government supported by the greens. Since then its first milestone has been delayed by 10 years (2025 -> 2035) and current president [Emanuel Macron has said that ""France's energy future will depend on Nuclear power.""](https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2020-12-08-emmanuel-macron-announces-that-france-s-energy-future-will-depend-on-nuclear-power.HJDpoV86iw.html)",

I will henceforth refer to (i.e hydro and biomatter are excluded) variable renewable energy as VRE, since that's a lot shorter. VRE is only responsible for 20% of EU's electricity production. Portugal gets 28% of its electricity from hydro, VRE accounted for merely 30% together. Meanwhile the number in Germany for VRE is 37.7%. These countries also import a large portion of their electricity supply from neighboring countries that are capable of ramping up power production as needed (usually fossil fuel plants).

A key problem with your second article is that the study it is based on has very incomplete data for VRE penetrations above ~45% and that fossil fuel reserve systems aren't excluded. This means their statements regarding cost are a lot less relevant for a scenario where we want a clean energy grid and VRE portions start approaching higher levels.

Your source for the price estimate is also problematic, here is some [critique it received](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/economic-aspects/economics-of-nuclear-power.aspx).

>A November 2018 report from Lazard compared the LCOE for various generation technologies on the basis of its estimates, related to input from ""a wide variety of industry participants"". For nuclear power (2200 MWe plant), capital cost including financing (at a high discount rate) ranged from $6500 to $12,250 per kilowatt, and the LCOE accordingly varied from $112 to $189/MWh. For a 600 MWe coal plant the capital cost ranged from $3000 to $8400/kW, giving a LCOE of $60 to $143/MWh. Gas combined cycle (550 MWe) capital cost was $700 to $1300/kW and LCOE $41 to $74/MWh. The purpose of the study was to compare these figures with 'alternative energy technologies', particularly wind and solar PV, but without taking account of system costs. The nuclear costs estimated by Lazard were well above those in the IEA-NEA study based on existing projects, with well-referenced data.

[Here is the cost estimate in the mentioned study](https://i.imgur.com/B3rmtaT.png), also included in the main article containing the critique, but I thought I'd add it here too for ease of access.


The following [study by the oecd](https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_15000) also makes estimations on grid level system costs comparing VRE and nuclear. (p.s, I've started working on reading through the whole thing, it's very interesting, but also like... 200 pages.)

The integration of large shares of intermittent renewable electricity is a major challenge for the electricity systems of OECD countries and for dispatchable generators such as nuclear. Grid-level system costs for intermittent renewables are large ($8-$50/MWh) but depend on country, context and technology (onshore wind < offshore wind < solar PV). Nuclear system costs are $1-3/MWh.

They make several very interesting observations regarding how improper implementation of VRE leads to an economic enviroment that favors fossil fuel peaker plants, due to their low capital costs and ability to shut down with relative ease. Unlike for instance pumped hydro storage, other energy storage solutions and nuclear power.

Solar Power produces energy in the daytime and does nothing at night (this gets even worse when you take seasons into account in the far northern and Southern hemispheres). Wind relies on fickle air streams for their power generation. One example of this problem is that clustering too many wind turbines together can have adverse and unpredictable effects on their energy production. This means they can not be relied upon for baseline energy production. Other sources are required to shore up these renewables and balance out the energy fluctuations they create in our electricity networks.

[You can read more about this problem in this paper here.](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~aiellom/tesi/blegten.pdf)

Nuclear power is however fully capable of being the primary energy provider in its current state. Sure, constructing nuclear power is expensive, but any solution to fossil fuels will be, whether that be nuclear power or future renewables with massive energy storage plants.

Just look at [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France), they have been operating more than 50 fission reactors for thirty years now without any major incidents. This has allowed their grid to be almost entirely free from fossil fuels since the *80's*. The only other nations to be able to do such things are either also using nuclear power or have access to large amounts of hydro power.

The reason for the so called ""decline"" of nuclear Power is the unwillingness of governments to take action and invest in greener solutions than fossil fuels, because fossil fuels are dirt cheap (because they are dirty). *That* is the main competitor to nuclear power, not renewables.

What we need is to start implementing a proper solution *right now*. That power source is nuclear fission. Once we've purged fossil fuels from the global energy grid, we can start thinking of developing even better long term solutions such as fusion power or renewables. Meanwhile, renewables are excellently suited to an auxiliary role, where they can be balanced towards energy needs.

Nuclear Power Factoids:

* ""But Nuclear Power is *dangerous*!

[Casualties and damages from nuclear Power are in fact similar or even lower than those injuries and Deaths caused when installing wind and solar Power.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Energy_accidents&oldid=907702892)

* What about the *waste*?

There are massive storage facilities where the waste can safely become inert, and already a large amount of the waste is reprocessed into new fuel for reactors. Reactors running on waste is not far off either. [Topic overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_radioactive_waste_management)

* Nuclear power is *too slow*, it's too late to build them! We need renewables, they're fast and cheap to build.

Currently, the nation in the World that is increasing their renewable output the most is China, and they're increasing their nuclear output even faster. What this can tell you is that while each individual solar or wind Power plant installation is faster, increasing their energy output as a whole takes just as long as nuclear Power - if not longer. 

An additional problem is the lifespan of solar panels and wind turbines. Right now that's about thirty years. Denmark is a country that has been investing heavily in wind Power and are already having large problems with depreciation of power production and a buildup of hard-to-recycle waste in the form of glass-fiber wind turbine blades.

>We calculated the proportion of high quality green space (ie, recreational areas, forests, and wet and dry nature areas) within 150 m radius and 1000 m radius of each address, using land use and land cover maps of Denmark.41 Furthermore, for all Danish addresses, we estimated concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide for 2000, 2010, and 2015 using the Danish DEHM-UBM-AirGIS modelling system. Calculations in DEHM-UBM-AirGIS combine three models operating at different spatial scales (DEHM: regional background, UBM: urban background, and AirGIS: traffic in nearest streets), taking into account factors such as road and traffic information, street configurations, emissions from all Danish sources in high resolution, and background concentrations from outside Denmark.42 We subsequently calculated yearly and spatially averaged urban background PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide levels in Denmark for 1994-2017 using the DEHM-UBM model. These yearly background means were used to calculate yearly scaling factors, which we used to extrapolate the address specific estimates from 2000, 2010, and 2015 into yearly address specific means for 1994-2017.",

I did not miss any part of the article, nor the fact that Germany is a net electricity exporter - in fact I looked at those very charts regarding electricity. The key here is that Germany is *both* importing and exporting large amounts of electricity. This indicates that their grid is unstable (which is what you get when VRE becomes a significant part of grid production). Had their neighbors been as reliant on VRE as they are, overproduction would become an even more severe issue. Even as it is, German power producers will occasionally have to *pay* their customers to consume electricity on the intra-day market. (https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/why-power-prices-turn-negative)

We'll return to this later, but it is a key part of the hidden costs of VRE and why they're incapable of supporting the grid.

>Even more unfortunately for your argument here, hydropower and biofuels (as well as geothermal) are not going to just disappear. They are part of the solution here.

They don't go against my argument at all. They are absolutely excellent, but have other limitations (for hydro and geo mainly geographical), but IMO should be deployed and utilized to their maximum possible extent. Hydro and geo are objectively the *best* electricity sources in existence.  Hydro is largely already utilized to its maximum potential and is incredibly useful due to its inherent ability to (to a certain extent) buffer grid fluctuations and provide long-term electricity storage (in the form of kinetic energy). Biofuels/biomass are a different beast with a whole other host of pros and cons that I won't go into depth on now (competes with food production, natural ecosystems etc. etc.). They're also incredibly useful (biodiesel for instance allow existing ICE vehicles to become carbon-neutral).

---

>From the NUCLEAR Energy Agency. Worth noting.

No shit sherlock, they're the largest scientific organization that does research and statistics on (you guessed it) NUCLEAR energy. Just like the IRENA (International Renewable Energy Association) does studies on RENEWABLE ENERGY. This is the reason the IEA sources its cost estimates for nuclear power from the first and for renewables from the second (and the OECD/NEA joint study in turn cited the IEA for prices on renewables in their paper).


Also, why didn't you mention that Lazard in the very same study you got your price chart from pointed out that ""without storage however, these resources lack the dispatch characteristics, and associated benefits, of such conventional technologies""

https://www.lazard.com/media/451453/grphx_lcoe-10.jpg

I'd like to see a price chart like this one, where they instead of using gas peakers as backup systems they use electricity storage. That way we could properly compare nuclear power and VRE. In fact, even the 2035 report uses gas peakers in their  plan.

I went looking and found [this study](https://www.pnnl.gov/ESGC-cost-performance) on the LCOS that different electricity storage methods would require to break even.

---

I think a large portion of my sentiment comes from the consequences I've seen of poorly implemented VRE in my own country and others.

We had an almost 100% fossil free grid in Sweden between the mid 80's and 2020, relying on a mix of hydro and nuclear. Yet, the greens (founded on anti-nuclear sentiment) have had an increasing amount of influence, pushing for the abolition of nuclear and securing large subsidies for wind and solar. Our power prices have become a lot more volatile, overall slowly rising over the past 10 years, but things have come to a head recently. Last year the largest oil power plant was turned on for the first time in over a decade, and after the shutdown of yet another nuclear reactor in January has been ramping up its production. Meanwhile, electricity prices are skyrocketing (currently at 0.2USD/kWh and expected to double during the winter) and we've had blackouts in the capital due to a lack of power. Planned factories have been denied permission to start construction by local municipalities due to electricity concerns. One of the companies facing this problem is the worlds first fossil free steel producer, which may have to delay production start due to this.

---

The essential crux is this:

VRE alone cannot sustain a grid. Whilst they have a rated capacity, they will sometimes overproduce (leading to curtailment and negative power prices), sometimes not produce at all and are to a large degree season-dependent (far northern/southern latitudes). The former makes clean base-load operators unprofitable (since they can't reduce their production), whilst the latter benefits dispatchable peak producers (which are mostly fossil fueled). 

We need plentiful, reliable power. Nuclear can provide this. It has been proven previously, and is continuously reproven that investors are more than happy to provide favorable financing in regulated electricity markets, where long-term supply contracts can be signed and rules are stable (see South Korea).

---

In the end, it doesn't matter which method is used, the important part is that a lot of clean electricity is provided and we completely get rid of fossil fuels in electricity generation.",

There are massive monetary incentives for companies to hire these people. The sad fact is that many of them just aren't useful in high-skill occupations.

Add that on to issues like language, incompatible values etc. and it isn't surprising that many are pretty much unemployable. For instance, we had to let one of my colleagues go due to his attitude towards female staff and patients, even after being reprimanded several times.

It'd be interesting to see stats for the few unskilled jobs that do exist though. From what I've seen, a very large portion of those are filled by migrants.",

Reason why?

The main cause of death from solar is installation work on rooftops, which is quite dangerous. Plenty of people have been wounded or killed falling off.

The story for windmills is similar - working atop a 2-300m pillar isn't exactly safe.

Add to that the fact that each unit of wind or solar produces such a miniscule amount of power comparatively and the (almost) negligible risk becomes significant.

According to the laws of my country an HIV positive individual is not obligated to inform a sexual partner of their condition, even if they ask.

Now I'm going to create a scenario, so forget HIV for a moment. 

Two people are having a one night stand. Person A asks B  if they're on birth control/to use condom. They say yes, sex proceeds. It turns out B was not on birth control/did not use a condom and in fact knowingly tricked A. 

This is considered rape according to the laws of my country.

Now let's change up the scenario.

Person A asks B if they have any STD's. B says no. B does in fact have an STD (and knew this). A becomes infected with said STD.

This is considered assault according to the laws of my country.

 *But* if said STD is HIV and person B is treated, then it's fine.

Factory farming is a more efficient method to produce meat currently, which means it is the predereed one.

The day we can produce equivalent meat in an economic fashion without needing to farm animals is the day I'll stop arguing against the ludicrous demands vegans try (and thankfully fail) to enforce on the rest of society.

Unfortunately, that is also the day when most farmed animals are no longer economically viable and will within a rather short period of time become a low-population novelty, sort of like horses, or maybe even extinct.",

Solar Power produces energy in the daytime and does nothing at night (this gets even worse when you take seasons into account in the far northern and Southern hemispheres). Wind relies on fickle air streams for their power generation. One example of this problem is that clustering too many wind turbines together can have adverse and unpredictable effects on their energy production. This means they can not be relied upon for baseline energy production. Other sources are required to shore up these renewables and balance out the energy fluctuations they create in our electricity networks.

[You can read more about this problem in this paper here.](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~aiellom/tesi/blegten.pdf)

Nuclear power is however fully capable of being the primary energy provider in its current state. Sure, constructing nuclear power is expensive, but any solution to fossil fuels will be, whether that be nuclear power or future renewables with massive energy storage plants.

Just look at [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France), they have been operating more than 50 fission reactors for thirty years now without any major incidents. This has allowed their grid to be almost entirely free from fossil fuels since the *80's*. The only other nations to be able to do such things are either also using nuclear power or have access to large amounts of hydro power.

The reason for the so called ""decline"" of nuclear Power is the unwillingness of governments to take action and invest in greener solutions than fossil fuels, because fossil fuels are dirt cheap (because they are dirty). *That* is the main competitor to nuclear power, not renewables.

What we need is to start implementing a proper solution *right now*. That solution is nuclear fission. Once we've purged fossil fuels from the global energy grid, we can start thinking of developing even better long term solutions such as fusion power or renewables. Meanwhile, renewables are excellently suited to an auxiliary role, where they can be balanced towards energy needs.

Nuclear Power Factoids:

* ""But Nuclear Power is *dangerous*!

[Casualties and damages from nuclear Power are in fact similar or even lower than those injuries and Deaths caused when installing wind and solar Power.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Energy_accidents&oldid=907702892)

* What about the *waste*?

There are massive storage facilities where the waste can safely become inert, and already a large amount of the waste is reprocessed into new fuel for reactors. Reactors running on waste is not far off either. [Topic overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_radioactive_waste_management)

* Nuclear power is *too slow*, it's too late to build them! We need renewables, they're fast and cheap to build.

Currently, the nation in the World that is increasing their renewable output the most is China and they're increasing their nuclear output even faster. What this can tell you is that while each individual solar or wind Power plant installation is faster, increasing their energy output as a whole takes just as long as nuclear Power - if not longer. 

An additional problem is the lifespan of solar panels and wind turbines. Right now that's about thirty years. Denmark is a country that has been investing heavily in wind Power and are already having large problems with depreciation of power production and a buildup of hard-to-recycle waste in the form of glass-fiber wind turbine blades.

First they were conquered by the ottomans (which for all intents and purposes was the de facto islamic state, caliphate and all) and remained under the oppression of Islam for several hundred years. Then, during a bloody civil war Ali Pasha reestablishes the integral Egyptian lands under his rule (though still nominally under ottoman rule). In the 1880's they also became a british protectorate. It then took them two (nationalist) revolutions (one of them side by side with Israeli nationalists funnily enough) to free themselves from Ottoman and British rule and later a third ""revolution"" (more of a war tbh) to secure the Suez.

Egypts independence was due to nationalism and war, not Islam. Same for most other middle-eastern countries. The nature of the Arab revolt was just that, an *arab* revolt, not a *muslim* revolt.",

I recommend reading this simple introduction to gain a better understanding on the subject. If there's anything you feel is unclear, feel free to ask and I'll try to explain it.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand

There's little point in discussing this further with you until you gain a better understanding. But, I'll try to describe the reasons behind the EU energy crisis to you in simpler terms. 

There is currently a lack of cheap electricity because of [A] Nuclear power plants having been shut down in Germany, Belgium and Sweden without appropriate replacements [B] French nuclear reactors being under maintenance to prolong their lifespans [C] Lack of wind and Sun (which should be expected to a certain extent due to the winter season), leading to VRE (variable renewable energy a.k.a wind and solar power) producing far less electricity.

Furthermore, the consumption is high at the moment due to the winter season.

A lack of production and high consumption causes the price of electricity to rise. This makes electricity production using more expensive fossil fuels (such as oil and gas a.k.a LNG) profitable. Said power plants turn on to cover the lack of electricity production.

Now we increase the consumption of fossil fuels, which in turn increases the price of these fossil fuels. This means, in other words, that the high price of fossil fuels indicates that we are consuming an unusually *large* amount of them, which is very bad for the enviroment.

Now, with that done, on to the statements you made.

First off, you make these statements entirely without sources to back them up.

I have not seen any sources from you to indicate that France subsidizes its energy sector, Germany did however pour some 50B€ into renewable subsidies in 2020 alone, indicating that their electricity is expensive, unreliable *and* subsidized. I find cheap, reliable subsidized electricity preferrable - if it even is subsidized.

Meanwhile, Germany is more dependent than ever on (Russian) gas. If independence from Russia is the goal Germany is failing miserably.

>Sure, except it hasn't, unlike places like the US have. The grid is the most reliable in the world.

Texas didn't have an actual grid collapse. They just got about as close as you can get. Their overreliance on Gas, wind and coal power  without proper planning for low temperatures was the issue. (Does this sound familiar or is that just me...)

Oh right, Germany has also been forced to implement emergency load-shedding to prevent a grid collapse. So they've also been close, just not quite as close, but if a similarly unprecedented event as hit texas were to hit Europe... Well there's no telling what might happen. 

Amongst the European grids the German is amongst the less reliable ones. The French, Norwegian and Swedish ones for instance have a far better track record, especially in recent years.

Doesn't need to be. If you read the article, it focuses on the soaring *oil* and fossil fuel prices, only tangentially mentioning the relevance of renewables to this situation.

What this means in practice is that once your VRE production fluctuations exceed what you can easily compensate with existing hydro dams (you basically always want as many of those as you can possibly get), it is more economical to just build the rest of your power production as nuclear (assuming we have a 100% fossil free requirement and excluding a handful of niche solutions such as biomass and geothermal which aren't viable on a large scale).",

The continental grid has been close to collapse several times during 2021 (which is completely unprecedented compared to previous years).

Simply producing hydrogen for electricity storage I think is a poor idea, but where hydrogen shines is energy density. It can serve as an excellent fuel for heavy vehicles that need to travel long distances (trucks, busses, aircraft, trains, boats). This also grants the system an additional layer of energy inertia and thus increases the portion of our electricity production that can be variable renewable energy.

There are a number of other useful ideas such as smart electricity grids, pumped hydro, kinetic electricity storage etc. that can increase the optimal percentage of VRE in the energy mix.

I also agree that Nuclear fission is the present solution for the electricity crisis. We know that it can solve the problem and we can start implementing it now and fix it later. Every other option has hypotheticals and rely on future technology and complicated systems.",

The difference in carbon footprint between keeping existing compact (fuel efficient) ICE vehicles running and replacing them with new EV's are far smaller than many people think, especially in nations with a poor electricity mix (such as the US).

Where I live, the competition is far harder (since we have a good electricity mix). The lowest estimated footprint per 100km according to my source (it was the first accessible, relevant article I found when searching) is [1700g/100km](https://www.treehugger.com/evs-not-magic-bullet-analysis-5216827). 

Our current vehicle is a 2004 Audi A2, emits 13200g/100km (Tesla footprint for global electricity mix is 19900g/100km) when running on fossil fuels (based on our current fuel consumption of 0.49L/100km). However, we currently fuel our car with biodiesel, which reduces the carbon footprint by ~90%, bringing the number down to 1320g/100km, or just 78% of the lowest estimated emissions of a Tesla model 3 per kilometer over its lifetime.

In other words, this vehicle (and many other fuel efficient ICE vehicles) should be kept running on biofuels until the end of their reasonable life (I'd consider 'reasonable' to be when a major overhaul is needed, such as an engine replacement).

In my humble opinion, the order of priority should be the following: remove large ice vehicles from the road -> sustainable energy grid-> replace heavily used ICE vehicles with electric/hydrogen vehicles -> fossil fuels in heating and heavy industry begone -> replace personal ICE vehicles.",

If you do succeed in getting to know him (meeting once or twice) and he still seems like someone you want to date, ask him out (and make it clear that you're asking him out on a date) by the end of the meetup!

If he accepts that's just good, if he rejects you, ""take it like a man"". 

I have a couple of friends myself that I've asked out and been rejected by. The potential upside is infinite and if you miss your chance you'll always remember the one you missed.

Of course, I'm not you, nor am I an expert. There's a whole bunch of context missing, so use your brain. 

If you just need someone to talk to about it, feel free to send me a dm.",

Since the reason for the closure of the power plant (Fessenheim) was political in nature (inspections had deemed it safe to run for until 2041 on the condition of continued inspections), the French government is forced to pay 400million € for the costs of shutting the plant down in addition to 21 years loss of earnings.

In the linked study they do consider interconnects. What you're writing about does sound interesting though, do you have an article you could link? Even that mightn't help for the situation we had in Europe this year though. Poor winds across the entire continent for an entire year really highlights the weaknesses of VRE. The cause for the grid instabilities in California and Texas is similar (large portions of VRE without appropriate dispatchable options whether that be storage or power plants) as far as I'm aware. EV's still have a rather low penetration (even in California only ~8% last I saw) but it certainly will become a bigger portion. It's certainly something that needs to be planned for though!
2. The study did raise the hypothetical scenario where VRE overnight costs are reduced significantly (30-70% price reduction compared to the 2020 figures they used). This arrived at an optimal portion of 30-50% VRE generation, 40-60% dispatchable low carbon electricity generation, storage and a widely expanded grid interconnection between electricity generation areas. It is interesting to consider the huge overcapacity you're proposing, that comes with its own flaws - huge price volatility. It'd need a fundamentally different pricing model, since there is no such thing as ""free"". The cost of this 4-500% overcapacity needs to be sustained somehow or it won't exist. Perhaps a flat subscription model instead where the provider would be forced to significantly reimburse the customer in the case of outages. It'd certainly change the incentive structure.
3. Most high-energy industries that I have any insight into have huge costs associated with any shutdown of production that hasn't been carefully planned long in advance and any changes to said industry will also be associated with massive short-term costs. The incentives of logistics and production point towards high-efficiency, centralized industry rather than what you propose. It'd might in fact be cheaper for them to fund construct their own power supplies than adapt to a volatile electricity system. I do however think there is an interesting opportunity to *create* such energy-flexible industries. As it currently seems, battery tech is far too bulky to efficiently use in road vehicles intended for cargo. If they instead used hydrogen, the ability of their fuel industry to act as a massive energy buffer for the system would enable larger VRE usage. Since it seems other industries (mainly thinking of steel here) may also transition into hydrogen, there will definitely be a market.

VRE has a place in the electricity mix and so does nuclear. The main question is what portions of each is optimal in the final system. What is clear though is that we need to massively expand electricity production of both types. In 2020, the global energy consumption was 160PWh, whilst global electricity production was a mere 25,8 PWh of which 61% came from fossil fuel sources.",

We can instead compare the cost calculations for nuclear in that paper to the one you linked.

The estimated cost for a <1g emissions system replacing all fossil fuels with new nuclear power ends up at ~100USD/MWh or 1 cent/kWh. Meanwhile, the most favorable expected cost per kWh from the ""Rethinking energy"" paper you linked (California, Lowest Cost 100% SWB System + 20% Investment, 100% utilization of excess power) comes to 1.2 cents/kWh or ~120USD/MWh. 

Additionally, electricity from nuclear power is fundamentally more worth in this scenario due to its predictable nature. The nuclear scenario also does not consider the potential reductions in cost of nuclear power expansions if it were greatly increased, whilst the latter assumes 80% reductions in costs of batteries and PV as well as a 40% reduction in wind power costs by 2030. Also remember that a majority of Europe (where I live) is further north than New England, which was the most expensive scenario presented in ""Rethinking Energy"", with costs upwards of 400USD/MWh.

Addressing end note L in the ""Rethinking energy"" paper - the capacity factor of nuclear power is usually considered to be 80% to account for lower production as well as outages.

On the subject of 2: shipping. The largest sizes of container ships are now becoming so large that they are candidates for ship-borne nuclear power plants. Alternatively, solar panels could reduce the if some logistical issues are worked out (namely how to access the containers if you've covered the ship in solar panels), but a friend and I came to the conclusion that such a solution would be able to provide 20-30% of the power of the diesel engines they're currently running on. Besides, existing ships already have diesel-electric generators, which could be repurposed to act as electric motors.

It's been interesting writing with you! You clearly have dived deep into the subject, which I appreciate. I'll be busy the coming days, but if you feel like discussing the topic more, please do send me a DM.",

Longer digestive tracts allow extracting energy from the food for longer, which is useful for foods that require more processing and energy investment to provide a return (plants). However, they also have a higher energy maintenance.

Any energy that remains in the food when it arrives at the end of the digestive tract would be defecated in the form of detritus giblets.",

This hasn't been done for Cannabis. Many low-level studies point towards adverse health effects for the user and surrounding people (particularly smoked cannabis has similar adverse effects to smoked tobacco), but also mental health of the user and others who might be exposed. For positive health effects/medicative uses, see my addendum to the last point.

* Safety of the user and others: Cannabis is a mind-altering drug that affects the judgement of affected individuals. This is related to risks in many workplaces as well as in the operation of vehicles and such. It also poses a danger to minors.

* Addictive substances alter the mind of a subject in order to make them continue using the product. Large companies have enough methods of abusing customers without access to these tools.

* Bad precedent: Legalizing one drug opens the door for legalizing others. Cannabis is perhaps one of the least harmful drugs out there, however, once we start legalizing addictive substances, that's a door that may be difficult to close. (see how alcohol and tobacco already being legal were used as a battering ram for legalizing cannabis in the US?)

* Argument for medicative uses - run it through the proper tests like every other that's sold (usually isolating the active substance in a controlled fashion); Argument for performance enhancement for artists - the same could be said about anabolic steroids for athletes or LSD for painters.

My municipality uses a herd of sheep to keep the undergrowth tidy in fenced off greenery areas. They're harvested for wool and (in some cases) butchered for meat.

My aunt and cousins have operate a small farm with mixed forestry and a few cattle. A small portion of their land is suitable for crop fields and is used to grow grains.

A slightly smaller area is too rocky and hilly for fields, so are grazed by cattle. In the winter the cattle are fed with hay they harvest from small grass areas in their area (in exchange for them cutting it).

Yep, I meant wattage not voltage, just a tad tired. Charging batteries at a lower wattage is beneficial due to how heat increases their resistance.

The US has *way* too many parking spaces than are needed. Perhaps a better rephrasing of that'd be ""Every parking space expected to be used in a day.""

I agree that would probably be 1/3-2/3 out of all* US parking spaces to keep EVs connected to the grid for 90% of the time they are stationary (enabling benefits mentioned in previous comment).

Read the whole sentence bro...:

>Adding to this that your average EV needs to charge 3-4x as frequently it becomes pretty clear why *in-home charging* is a necessity. 

I'm not claiming that EVs need to visit public fast chargers 3-4x as often. Specifically to avoid this it is better to have an extensive availability of low-voltage chargers where possible. Of course, long distance travel is where this becomes an issue.

Anyway, for the second half - why 1 slow charger per parking spot?

For EVs to be affordable and efficient (low weight), we want to keep down the battery mass of the vehicle. This limits range. For EVs to be used by everyone however, range is a requirement. 

Slow chargers are relatively cheap, and if we are building for a society where all cars are electric, being able to connect a vehicle to the grid anyplace you park has several benefits:

- Range extension, *you* may have a vehicle capable of making your entire day trip, but with the option to slow-charge at work, the grocery store and anywhere cars are parked, it gives all EVs longer ranges. This allows vehicles with more limited ranges (whether old or cheap) and charging speeds to be continuously useful. Might not apply to you, but definitely something that'll help make electric transport affordable to the average person.

- Significantly reduces the need for fast-charging infrastructure since all local trips would be handled by slow chargers.

- Reduces strain on the electricity grid, since vehicles are charged at a trickle rather than in burtsts. This is also more efficient (less energy lost to heat due to lower wattages).

- Smart systems, keeping as much battery capacity connected to the grid as possible creates an energy buffer and allows utilization in an intelligent way. Important if we are to have a large % of variable renewables connected to the grid to sustain an electrified vehicle fleet.

- Autonomous vehicle storage. In a future of self-driving EVs, there will likely be an increase of subscription taxi services which grant access to a network with self-driving vehicles. These do not belong at a domicile and could instead park overnight outside residential areas (or perhaps at the local grocery store), reducing the need for garages and parking spaces.

[No. of assault rapes in Denmark per year, statistic made by newspaper from studying crime cases.](https://www.bt.dk/voldtaget/unik-optaelling-10-ud-af-12-overfaldsvoldtaegter-begaas-af-indvandrere-eller) For the relevant year, the number of convicted assault rapists per year was 8.

[Complete statistics on sex crimes in Sweden.](https://bra.se/statistik/statistik-utifran-brottstyper/valdtakt-och-sexualbrott.html) For the year that the above danish statistic was produced, the number of convicts was 129.

Sweden had a 43% larger population than Denmark in the relevant year - which with some quick math delivers a 7.5x multiple. I was being somewhat conservative in my earlier head maths.

I currently cannot find the source for the number of assault rapes in Sweden in 1997, but I believe it was from the BRÅ crime statistics as well.

>But let's not beat around the bush. Your timeline and the suggestion (even the Wikipedia acknowledges the racism on this) is that immigrants are behind the increase in rapes in Sweden. If that's the case how come Sweden has bigger raw numbers than the origin nations?

Because many of the origin countries suffer under oppressive religious law. Women are heavily oppressed under those laws, with domestic rape being allowed, the testimony of women codified in law as being ""half that of a man"", being forced to marry their rapists, risking being stoned to death etc. etc. etc.

In fact, on that very topic, another problem that has come to light in the past years is a significant increase of arranged child marriages. Girls (minors) are brought out of Sweden by their guardians and taken to countries where child marriage is legal and married off to older men, often times against their will.",

One pump at a gas station is able to service 6-10 cars per hour and even the tiniest rural stations have at least two pumps.

Meanwhile, the fastest fast chargers get in perhaps 2-3 cars in an hour (assuming charge-time optimization for longer trips)

Adding to this that your average EV needs to charge 3-4x as frequently it becomes pretty clear why in-home charging is a necessity. 

The goal for EV-charging infrastructure will basically have to be 1 slow charger per parking spot (including street parking and home garages) and additional fast charger arrays along all routes for long distance travellers (which includes cars and trucks).",

Green/Renewable energy: Significant amounts of electricity (though much less than for H2 reduction) are needed in the perovskite CO2<->CO cycle. I do not know whether they used current UK grid as a basis for emissions reduction or a 0% CO2 green grid.

Perovskite cycle: Perovskite (an, at present somewhat rare mineral extracted in 2 places worldwide) is used in a reaction cycle that recaptures CO2 and cycles it back to the iron reduction reaction in the form of CO. This requires the construction of new chemical reactors in conjunction to the foundries. These would be powered by electricity and creates some surplus pure O2 that could be captured and sold. From the wording in the study, it seems the Perovskite is not consumed in the reaction and can be reused ad infinitum. This is supposed to reduce the need for CO input into the process by 90%.

Heat efficiency: The study method proposes using heat exchangers to recapture and retain heat, the idea here is to achieve up to 90% energy savings.

Coke: CO from the Perovskite cycle and the 90% increased energy efficiency from thermal exchangers supposedly reduces the need for coal coke by up to 90%. athe study proposes replacing the remaining 10% of coke with biomass in the form of charcoal or other similar energy/coal sources.

ROI: The study claims to make a full return on investment within two years. IMO this seems... optimistic.

Practical viability: The study covers the theoretical possibility of such a cycle. Further studies are needed to examine whether it is viable in practice.",

The ethnic group is has two major subgroups, Ashkenazi (Caucasian/European) and Sephardim (Arab/Middle-Eastern/African).

Another fun fact is that jewish people are one of the least religious (highest share of atheists/agnostics) demographics worldwide. An important reason to distinguish between the ethnicity and faith.

The result was interesting. The number of sold plastic bags increased 300% during the year of implementation, however, the bags being sold were now on rolls (which weren't subject to the tax).

In order to completely rid our *energy mix* (energy, not electricity) of fossil fuels, we will need all available clean energy types at our disposal, cost be damned. We aren't trying to rid ourselves of fossil fuels because it's cheap, but because we need to, which means that any cost argument is secondary.

Nuclear is the only clean baseload energy source, and amazingly reliable at that job. Nations with active nuclear industries have construction times of about 8 yrs, and I bet that we could push that down lower (as well as cost) if we started large scale projects. Besides, we have many new types of reactors without the problems of the old generations.

Hydro is currently the only viable grid-level energy storage implemented. The cost to build might be prohibitive, it is physically limited by geography and associated with certain ecological issues, but we *need* as much of it as possible, since it synergizes so well with the other types of renewable energy.

Wind is excellent in many areas - and perhaps has the potential to be the single cheapest source, when grid storage is not needed. Excellent in combination with hydro power.

Solar - possibly the most limited of the renewable energy sources, but excellent in parts of the world where significant amounts of electricity consumption is tied to sunlight (i.e, places that are hot & sunny year round with a need for AC). However, farther from the equator where seasons bring dark months, it's usefulness is highly limited.

Biomass and biogas (*not NG!*) - questionable whether it counts as renewable, but can act as baseload and grid-level responses to fluctuations in supply & demand. Best used in very limited quantities.

Chemical battery storage - Prohibitively expensive,  questionable whether it is viable with current tech and associated with significant fossil fuel energy usage as well as ecological damage. Best avoided, aside from in auxiliary functions where the batteries have another main purpose (i.e using grid connected EV's to cover small grid spikes). Also has not yet been implemented at scale.

Chemical energy storage - (i.e hydrogen electrolysis & others) Less expensive, but associated with significant energy losses. Probably of the more viable long-term energy storage methods, but has yet to be implemented at scale. Possibly most useful as a side product from processes that'd need H2 anyway - such as clean steel production.",

The amount of CO available is strictly neccessary for the process used in BF(Blast Furnace)-BOF(Basic Oxygen Furnace) facilities (which make up 70% of worldwide steel-making facilities).

Hence, previously, even though it was previously possible to mitigate heat energy needs for the process, the CO was the limiting factor in reducing coal coke usage. The Perovskite cycle enables CO2 cycling in the process, and thus also the usage of heat exchangers.

The main point of this breakthrough is that (as you mentioned) the cost of constructing a new DRI(Direct Reduced Iron)-EAF(Electric-Arc-Furnace) facility is cost prohibitive (1.1-1.7bn$) and that would still leave behind a fully functioning BF-BOF facility that would continue running. Meanwhile, the initial cost of this modification to existing facilities was estimated at 370mn$.",

Thus it was that eight men with a combination of bows and spears slung over their shoulders, wearing garb made mostly from a combination of leather and furs, came into sight of the settlement. Whilst they were imposing perhaps, armed with gear that could fell the largest of animals, their demeanor did not indicate hostility.

Most eye-catching perhaps was the elder at the front, waving one of his hands in greeting. Upon the other wrist was perched a raptor, gazing intently out over the landscape. Its claws were dug sharply into a thick leather vambrace around the mans lower arm, from which dangled colorful feathers and an assortment of small shells and bones.",

**A Slots**

* **Plank Boats**

With the ever present significance of river travel in Serengri life, canoes were posing a limiting factor in the transport of both goods and people. Thus, it was perhaps not surprising that with the abundance of wood further increasing in the wake of other innovations that some of this excess material would find its way into the construction of more boats. With plank carpentry being used plentifully in the construction of buildings, the idea of using these to construct larger river vessels came into being.

* **Drop Nets**

Even as the importance and volume of river trade increased with new innovations in boatbuilding, the size and scope of Serengri trading settlements grew noticeably. This meant that even with the growth of agriculture, these settlements relied on an import of food in exchange for crafts and services in order to maintain a steady food supply. In this shift of dynamics, the significance of local fishermen grew and were seeking new ways to improve river yields. A new method of using nets dropped into the water from boats allowed them to fish further away from the river banks than simple weirs and spears had previously.

**B Slots**

* **Handled Axes**

[RP](https://www.reddit.com/r/DawnPowers/comments/13xhxnk/an_abundance_of_wood/?)

TL;DR: When you're surrounded by woods and have to chop them down on the regular, putting your wedge on top of a handle is a very good idea. This innovation also leads to an increase in the amount of timber available, which is significant for other innovations this week.

* **Wood Pegs**

The idea of using a small piece of wood to fasten together two other pieces of wood might not seem revolutionary, but in a time before nails, they certainly were.

This seemingly small improvement followed shortly after that of the handled axe, spurred by the recurring problem of tool heads being flung out of their seating on the regular. Chipping a groove into the tool head and using a small, carved piece of wood to fasten it into the handle proved to be a spectacular little solution which quickly found its way into other Serengri works of carpentry.

* **Threshing**

With the increasing availability or arable land following the invention of the handled axe, the amount of grains that needed to be meticulously separated by hand from their straws was growing rapidly.

One day a farmer became so enraged by the tedious nature of this menial labor that he took it out on a bushel of rice by repeatedly thrashing it against the ground, and to his surprise, some of the grains fell off! During the following half-hour an increasingly bemused audience gathered, watching his antics, and the tale of this slightly more efficient method spread rapidly.

Though the tale of this ""invention"" may quickly have become piece of embellished folk lore at this point, it has given some youngsters the impression that sometimes, just sometimes, smashing things violently does solve problems. Much to the consternation of their elders.

* **Grindstones**

While the tale of this invention is far less interesting than the previous one, it is arguably more important, and once more ties back to the increase in arable land and availability of grain.

The enterprising matron of an inn found that a rice cake recipe she'd been taught by her Oma sold quite well. Being located at the trading grounds, there was an ample supply of rice, though the amount of labor to crush it into the meal that was needed became prohibitive. So, in an effort to save time, she had successively larger stones brought in to handle this load. Over her lifetime, the method was slowly perfected, one round stone rotating on top of another, grinding the rice in between. Eventually, her descendants would do away with both the inn and baking, when realizing that running a mill commercially at the trading post was far more profitable.",

**RP** (TBD but related to existing posts)

Following the discovery of the [horse people](https://www.reddit.com/r/DawnPowers/comments/13wxokx/river_running/) in the southern valley and the boon of trading with them came an influx of Serengri people settling the trade route along the river.

As for the northern and eastern expansions, this is a product of population pressures (The Serengri currently have rather poor land usage, which leads to a rather low pop density) and innovations in boatbuilding technology.",
