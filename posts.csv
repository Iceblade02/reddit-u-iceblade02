The ore itself was of no use to the Aquitinians, but new methods used in Zefar, and Tekata soon remedied that, and **Iron Working** became common in smithies to the [north](http://imgur.com/0KbrzVX). Great Iron mines were constructed, together with large smithies. This led to a booming industry, as the whole country was ironed (pun intended). The merchants who practically owned the new city (Ketalida), quickly became rich, through their new monopoly, this soon led to the [Corruption of the Kazern](https://www.reddit.com/r/DawnPowers/comments/4dh58w/hidden_in_plain_sight/).

Together with these new methods for working iron, certain tools were imported, among those were **Bloomeries**, **Bellows** and the ~~**Tuyere**~~.

During the summer of 389 BCE, a strange phenomenon happened in the skies, a the brief birth of a bright star, but it quickly passed, fading from the skies in a matter of days. Most never even noticed it's coming, but those who did were worried. The sign didn't come alone, the red star passed over the sky during the same week. This red ""star"" was often seen as the sign of war, and combined with the other events on the sky, people called it an omen.

---

In many places, the omen was ignored, but one lord heeded it, he and his riders took it as a blessing from his gods, and rode to war with his neighbors, swiftly subduing the surrounding lands.

However, he didn't stop there, the men of the conquered lords saw him as a man from the gods, and followed him as he rode further, and further from home.

---

During the spring of 383, he reached the lands of the Kelashi, quickly entering the realm on their horses, the Mehnu's men plundering, killing, and raping as they, went offing any lords that didn't bend their knee. Unlike any other armies, these were swift, and left no time to prepare.

So, the Crisis is in SW dawn, according to [this map](http://imgur.com/a/cWSi4). 

These raiders burn, subjugate and destabilize your societies, if nothing, or very little is done, you might just become the vassal of a new ""Mongol"" empire of sorts.



You don't *have* to RP anything on the astronomical phenomenons, but it would of course be a nice addition.

EDIT: (To clarify, anyone could use these omens for their RP, as it would be seen by most.)"

* During the raids in the ongin lands, the Enli learned several things from them. Among these were the usage of **saddles**, **reins** and **stirrups**. These came to great help when riding horses, and the couriers of Al-Kapor soon learned how to use them.

* Along with rich people came the desire for good foods. Visitors in Ashad lands had tasted **honey preserved** foods that where very sweet.

The Aquitinians, always interested in the ways of the sea have carefully studied the more advanced ways of navigation used by the Tao-Lei. Through their unending curiosity they managed to learn about **Celestial navigation**. They have also noticed that during daytime, the Tao-Lei study the birds of the seas, and the currents of the sea acquiring **bird and current navigation** (are those one tech?). They have also noticed a slight difference in the way the Tao-Lei have formed their oars. They tried duplicating it, and when comparing to normal oars, the **Sculling oars** where superior.


**Natural techs**


The aquitinians have always sought more water-resistant clothes and have, after a lot of experimentation, realized that **tanning** hides leads to the more water resistant leather being produced.

After accidentaly catching shrimps in a fish trap, the Aquitinians noticed that these creatures of the sea where remarkably tasty. So they went about catching more of them. This resulted in the **Shrimp trap** being constructed.

After realizing that leather was waterproof, the Aquitinians thought: You can keep water in it, if its waterproof! So after some experimentation they realized that lining the leather with the bladder of sanga cattle prevented water from seeping out, they had a **Water skin**.

After moving into the new region of Shalone, the Aquitinians noticed a strange creature (the guinea fowl). So they called upon their more animal-cunning friends, the Orlo. The orlo quickly tamed the Guinea fowl. **Domesticated Guinea Fowl**.

After a lot of bad experiences with canoes capsizing in bad weather, the Aquitinians thought, wood floats, what if you extended the canoe on either side? Thus the first **Outrigger canoe** was built.

In the new region of Shalone, a party of Orlo travelling in the northern parts noticed a strange plant. Through their knowledge of herbalism, they managed to domesticate the new crop known as **rice**.

Deep sea trade, and the high seas forced our employers to rethink. They not only thought in two plains, but built higher boats, with more masts. We were the first to sail these ships, but when the war came, they were our homes. They served us well, and they will continue to serve us. [A step towards Dhows, but these ships are nothing near the real thing]

During our years at sea, we came across many foreign ships, some of which we kept, as our own, and others, whom joined us. At the end of the century, a small fleet of **mtepes** and ~~**biremes**~~ rested in the harbor of Gur Tzi. [Diffused from Tao, Tenebrae & Rewbokh.]

~~In the bay of Gur Tzi, large waves often crashed ashore, tipping smaller boats, and sweeping resources and loot out to sea. To hinder this, we built **breakwaters**, to keep our little bay safe.~~

Large ships not only carried more cargo and men, but also sat deeper in the water. This led to problems, as Gur Tzi was located in shallow waters. Ferrying the cargo by smaller boats worked, but was very inefficient in the long run. To solve this problem, we set stone into the sea bed, and made a **pier** into deeper waters.

Sometimes, when we looted Tao ships, we came across small chests, containing round metal pieces. When inquiring to some friends from the Tao settlement on Bakku, they said that they were **coins**, a kind of currency used in Tao-Lei. This currency soon got a foothold in our city.

These chests not only held coins, they had another secret, **hinges**. This mechanism soon came to use in the growing society, on the coast of Ihai.

During pirate raids, one of the sailors came up with an idea:

If anchors could be used to fasten the ship to the sea bed, wouldn't it be able to hold another ship fast?

The answer soon came, after some experimentation, a local smith made a lighter anchor, with four arms instead of two. After a couple of succesful attacks, it got its name. The **grappling hook**.


**EDIT**

A tool that had been found in the burned city of Zefar-Nam, while scavenging, had been the **simple pulley**. It had quite a lot of uses, at it made the use of manpower more efficient. This tool had originally used to construct buildings was now put to work, lifting heave cargo into the city of Gur-Tzi. With the help from some of the Tao, that had come to the city, this tool was replicated.

As boats came, and went throughout the day, and night, some ships missed the harbor, as they did not see it in the dark. One of the ancient legends came to use here, the old story of the tower, with a fire in the cities of murtavira, that guided seafarers to their destination. At first, a smaller **lighthouse** was built, but in time, a bigger, and higher one was built, with the help of pullies."

Outside, the wind was howling, snow slowly but surely piling around the walls and onto the roof. In this weather, perhaps the coldest in memory, there was little to do. Yet, even so, the adults were working on small crafts, repairing tools, clothes and making arrows in the dim light.

The words of a girl could be heard, ""Oma"", she said, looking to the old woman with affection, ""would you please tell the story of the Winter Wanderer again?""

Oma smiled, looking up tiredly to meet the eyes of the girl. ""Of course, little one."", she replied. Her breathing was shallow, and she could feel the chill in her bones, yet, all that seemed a little more distant when all eyes settled on her, eager to listen. These tales that she herself had listened to in winters long ago she now told and retold.

She began, ""Long, long ago, before the trees of this house were even saplings, when the great ancients still walked the world...""

A noise interrupted the woman, and the little girl took the opportunity to ask a question. ""The great ancients? What were those Oma?"", but the girls older brother pulled her closer and shushed her gently. ""Let her continue.""

A rasping breath, ""...there was a young man, who lived far beyond the mountains, hunting strange game, as he had done, and his father before him. The mountains were the only home he knew. It was the middle of summer, yet seemingly overnight, the sun disappeared and snows began to fall. Winter had come, sudden and colder than the man had ever met before. The wind extinguished his fire and froze the water. Even as he left his camp, seeking a safer shelter, he found that not even wild animals survived the cold, dropping dead never to wake again. In any other weather, the man would have been ecstatic at the find, but here it brought only a sense of desperation. Looking up to the stars, near giving up, he saw a great falcon amongst them...""

Someone threw a new log on the fire, and sparks rose towards the roof, ""...the hunter knew not then whether his fate was to die in that terrible storm, but he followed the bird as it flew. Even as it flew, and the hunter followed, the ground rose and the weather became even colder. Multiple times, he was about to give up, but the sight of the majestic bird spurred him on, surrounded by those same shining stars. Weary, cold and starved they finally reached the very tops of the mountain, and the young man was stunned by awe. A great land stretched beyond, green and yet untouched by the claws of winter. The great **falcon** fell from the sky, deathly tired from its long flight towards warmth, but the hunter, despite also being on the brink, knew to save the bird that had faithfully led him to safety, feeding it and carrying it with him down into the warmth of the valley.""

Wide-eyed, the girl asked, ""What happened after that Oma? What happened?""

Smiling, the old woman replied, ""Now, little one, now, get some sleep, we will continue this story tomorrow.""

###Serengrys

The [lands](https://i.imgur.com/L5bfY83.png) inhabited by the Serengri lie along the southern edge of Tritoneas forested mountain range. The forested land is perfused by rivers and streams flowing from the mountains into the lands below. These serve not only as a source of sustenance in the form of fish and fresh water, but also as avenues of travel by canoe, connecting the sparsely settled Serengri people.

###Livelihood

The Serengri live fairly spread out, finding sustenance from a multitude of different sources, largely hunting animals and gathering plants & **herbs**. This is usually supplemented by either herding or wild-rice agriculture and fishing along the rivers. However, in drier areas farther from the rivers it became necessary to use some **basic irrigation** systems in order for the rice to survive. In this small-scale agriculture, **sickles** have served as an important tool.

During winter months, grains, **smoke cured** fish and meats provide a steady diet, whilst the Serengri can hide away in their earth & wood homes built by mallet & **shovel** to make crafts out of wood, **tanned** hides and other materials at their disposal.

###Society & Culture

Most Serengri live in relatively isolated settlements up to a handful of families - related by blood related to the matron - the eldest wedded woman. Inheritance and management of these multi-generational lands and settlements hence follows matrilineally. A clan can consist of roughly a dozen such settlements, tied together by marriages, where the husband of the most prosperous matron is considered the leader, representing the clan in political and diplomatic matters.

There are also a few larger settlements, having grown into existence due to their importance as minor trade hubs - tying the local region together and serving as gathering spots to mediate disputes and for the annual autumn festivals. Here, a law-giver, chosen by ""vote"" from amongst the local clan leaders, oversees matters of commerce, order and conflict.

When seeking courtship a young man must prove themselves worthy of the hand of a woman, showing that he can provide for her. This can come in many forms, such as being a craftsman or trader, through a dowry from his family, thus securing an alliance or by constructing a new homestead at an existing settlement or new location.

As such, it is not uncommon to find young men setting out with little more than a **backpack** and some tools to break a new plot of land and prove themselves worthy of the woman they are courting. So far, this has worked quite well with the sparse populous and a declining reliance on hunter-gatherer methods, but whether it is sustainable is yet to be seen.

HE told us that we could still save our country, from the greed of others, that HE would show us the way.

Lord Addam Fossoway of New Barrel, 47 - A widower since his wife Aemma Hightower died in childbirth the year 309. Addam himself was born in the year 274.

His Heir Ser Raynald ""Flowers"" Fossoway, 30 - Baseborn Flowers, Legitimized by the Iron throne in the year xxx. Married to Ceryse Fossoway of house Hightower. Father to two baseborn children and lover of two. He is as much a charmer of women as his father was.

His bastard Grandson Othello Flowers, a boy of 8 - The bastard son of Ser Raynald Fossoway and Tanya. This lad has taken a liking to fighting, always winning over his smaller brother in their wood sword tournaments. He does however not fancy reading or studying. His great promise as a swordsman prompted the Master-at-Arms Martyn Mossberry to help him with his training. He is his fathers favorite, always praised. 

His other Bastard Grandson Aemund Flowers, a boy of 7 - The bastard son of Ser Raynald Fossoway. Aemund has long looked up to Maesters, ever since Maester Petyr saved his mother from a harsh illness. He dreams of becoming a Maester himself, it seems that Petyr is taking great pleasure in tutoring, however good that is for the boy.

###The Household

The Castellan, Ser Morros Mossberry, 62 - Morros has long been in the service of House Fossoway, and is as good a castellan as one could ask for. He is the brother of Cedric, and Uncle to Martyn. He is also the grandfather to Reynald.

Dyanna Mossberry, 50 - The wife of Cedric Mossberry, and the mother of Martyn. Once she was the lover of the lord, but with age she has  lost her beauty and charm to the lord.

Cedric ""The Brewer"" Mossberry, 54 - He is the cider brewer of New Barrel and the father of Martyn Mossberry, also the husband to Dyanna.

Ser Martyn Mossberry, Master-at-Arms, 17 - He is the son of Dyanna, and (probably) Cedric. He i has shown himself good with the sword, and with the help of his earned himself the position of Master-at-Arms at a young age, even without proper battle experience.

The Maester, Petyr, 69 - Even though he is an old man, he retains his knowledge from the citadel. His knowledge of medecine has helped the family greatly, even though he puts the Citadel above the Fossoways.

Mallory Mossbury, 7 - The son of Ser Morros and his second wife. Just like Othello, he likes to fight with swords, and often trains with Othello and his uncle - The Master at Arms. His father has, through his many years of loyal service, managed to make Lord Addam promise him squirehood.

The two lovers of Ser Raynald: Eleana, a beauty from Lys, and Tanya from Qohor, the mother of Othello.

The Zeffarri to the south were happy to share their more advanced bows with the Aquitinian soldiers helping them in the revolution, this soon led to the making of **Self bows** in Aquitinia.

~~The interactions between the Tenebrae and the Aquitinans soon spread a more efficient way of making bows, using **Bracing** to make better use of their self bows.~~

~~The Aquitinians that lived in Tenebrae saw much of their weapons, and soon **Longbows.** spread to the Orlo hunters in Aquitinia.~~

**Natural techs**

Orlo builders that used stones in their construction always sought to make the gaps smaller, so that the houses became more isolated. They realized that shaping the stones, removing rough edges and fitting them together made for better structures, thus they started using **stone dressing**.

There is a stone, found in the tin mines of Zeqlan, which when burnt forms a powder. The powder burns one's skin and insects hate it. If the powder is mixed into a paste with water and ash it can be painted onto wood, stone, or other surfaces. There are three reasons for this one, the brilliant white colour, two, the anti-insect and fungus properties and, three, the waterproofing ability of the plaster. Though it takes days to dry once painted on it preserves wood building and keeps the wood as a useful construction material for decades, this is very useful, as many Aquitinian cities/towns are built on the coast. This material was known as **Lime plaster**.

~~The material used to make the lime plaster also made a very good sealant between the rocks used by Orlo builders, it not only kept the wind out, but was resistant to rain, and humidity. Soon **Lime mortar** was used all over the country.~~

Arsen farmers that had had a bad harvest, and only had little rice left crushed their rice, and mixed it with water, to make it last longer. This method soon lead to the making of a **rice pounder** that made the crushing of the rice easier.

Often, during storms, Aquitinian boats lost their masts, because of their sails. But a sailmaker that set out on a voyage, studying the sails, soon found out that the **Lateen sail** was more resistant to hard winds. 

Aquitinian boat builders often studied boats arriving in Aqqo, and not seldom did foreign boats arrive. These boats were often different in design, and inspired the boatbuilders. After a fisher requested a bigger ship, but couldn't afford a gableboat, he was sold a **Felucca**, using the new lateen sails."

After a few weeks of pondering, she ventured to the old, and dusty library, rolling out ancient maps that had been copied for centuries. Then she pieced them together. To the east lay the colony of Inami. She owned it, together with its surrounding lands. To the north and northeast lay the unknown. To the west was the crumbles of civilization eroded by the vast sea. In the northwest lay the Ongin and their realms.

10 gold pieces later, the new ruler left Curac on horse.

The inside of your house would become filled with smoke, and several other problems came. In the houses of wealthier merchants, they built funnels for the smoke, and put the fire underneath.

The **Horse** was becoming a common sight, and was a very good allround work animal. After a while, quite a good stock of horses were living in the area around Gur Tzi.

**EDIT**

* The people of Aden often clashed with the weather on the seas, but as time went on, they grew more experienced. Soon most captains knew their own share of basic **Meteorology**. This proved very effective, when attempting to avoid storms, and bad weather. As time went on, a small institution was created in Gur Tzi, where a few scholars worked full time on predicting the weather. They were funded by captains, who were reluctant to see their ships ruined by the ever changing sea.

* ~~On long travels over the ocean, lateen sails worked well all-round, but could not make full use of fair wind. This became more apparent when travelling over large distances, and some were trying to make better use of their sails. Some of the oldest scriptures, and drawings that had been kept were from the faraway land of murtavira. Tales of their mastery of the sea still prevailed, but the drawings were odd. Instead of having the standard lateen sail, they had their sails hanging limp, from a horizontal beam. After experimenting with the setup, a **Square rig** was build.~~"

There lies a little baby on the doorstep, in a rattan basket, bedded in the softest of cloth, a letter clutched in its hands, and a band of pearls around its neck.

I pick up the letter from the hands of the little child, and start reading it.

""*Thank you, for taking care of our baby, our little Pandela. The reason that we, that I leave her with you is that we have been running, and always shall run from the shadows following us.

However, it became the last rain that we would see in more than a year. That summer was surprisingly cool, but no rain came. Now, the year is 308 (631 BCE) since the founding of the city, and we still hope for rain. The wells have started to run dry in some areas, and the springs that fed our farms now trickle through the sun baked mud. The Rice didn't sprout this spring, and the granaries pf the cities are beginning to empty. It seems that the lack of rain is everywhere, neither the Ashad or the people of Al-Bakku have food to spare. What use is gold, when you can't eat it?

Others in the city call for mercy from their gods of Yin-Lei, or mumble prayers to Eni. The learned ask me, the wisest of the daala about the weather, and when rain is to come. Yet I can only answer: ""I know only that there is not a single sign, a single cloud to see in the sky""

I am lucky to be the son of a fisherman, we have become the lifeline of our village, together with the other fishers if course. Times may be rough, but fish always flows from the seas. The village elders are worried, our well is starting to run dry. The people from the bigger towns ate talking about an invention, where you can cook the water of the sea, and get drinking water. This might save us, the thirsty fishers traveling upon the salty seas.

This year our rice didn't sprout, neither did the flax. The cow is meager, nearly starved to death by the lack of grass, she doesn't give milk anymore. Father says we'll have to butcher her when the other food runs out, and move towards the sea. I think this is the last letter I will be able to give you. As we part, I must confess that I love you.

“*The tale that I tell you now, is the tale of our Broqas, and Branas, that live across the seas. It is also known as* **The Exile from home** *.*

“*In a time, long gone, in a country, long lost, the brothers and sisters of the Aquitinians and the Vire were one people. They lived happily together and thrived off the sea. Then some of the Vire became greedy, in want for more power, they grew to become tyrants, known as the Moy. The Moy ruled, and took as much as they could from the Vire, and the Aquitinians. They ruled for a long time, until the Aquitinians decided that they had had enough of the cruelty. Soon a small contingent of Aquitinians came to the Moy, to make them see their wrongdoings, but they wouldn’t. Soon after, a prominent Moy mysteriously disappeared, and later turned up dead….*”

A young boy interrupted: “*But amu, did they really kill him?*”

The grandfather solemnly answred “*We don’t actually know, am, but it is said that one of the Vire, together with one of us killed him, and that we all took the blame.*”

“*But why…*”

“*That, is another tale entirely, I shall share it with you, another night.*”

The old man continued ""*After the murder, a fierce debate erupted among the Moy, ""How should the people be punished?"",  ""Why did the gods so unduly punish a good man?"". Nevertheless, soldiers were sent out to find the murderers, and they treated the people brutally. Dissent brewed among the people, as they were taxed to starvation. One day, an Aquitinian known as Ondo Thassos saw Aqas, and he said: ""Thou shalt build boats for your people, you will know when to leave across the sea."" Soon after, there was rumors that the Moy were arranging festivities for the Aquitinians, as a sign of reconciliation. There was going to be food, games, snacks, gifts for everyone, but Aqas said unto Ondo: “This is no festival, it is merely to incite jealousy between the two peoples, the Vire and the Aquitinians. Leave now, and take any Aquitinians that will follow you, tell them not to worry, as I will take care of you.” Soon after, a group of Aquitinians left the land of the Vire, and set out, on the seas.*”

“*But what happened to those who stayed Amu?*”

“*Ah, those that stayed, were killed by the Moy, and the jealous Vire, it is said, though they still might be living, across the seas.*”

In some areas of the world, this would have been seen as a great boon, given that the products of trees, such as wood, sap and other materials can be of great use for carpentry, shipbuilding, tool-making, bowry and all kinds of human activity. For the Serengri however, it was more a nuisance than anything. Anytime a building was to be erected, land had to be cleared, and there was wood. Anytime a new plot was to be planted, there was wood. Anytime someone had to clear a path of travel outside of the rivers, there were trees.

The consequences of this would, over time, be many-fold. For one, it meant that people would seek to ease the back-breaking labour of tree-felling, whilst wedge-and mallet techniques had been used for many generations, attaching a handle (made from the very wood that they felled so often) to the very same wedge and using that as a tool head would significantly hasten the work.

This relatively simple innovation would even further increase the timber supply - as well as freeing up labor and time for other projects, some of which included clearing even more woodland to use for agriculture. 

It also meant an increase in construction of canoes, as well as experiments with building slightly larger vessels to travel along the rivers."

* In the new colony to the East, many creatures were not brought initial, and could not be found wild in nature. So, in time people would migrate there and slowly but surely bring domesticated creatures with them in the process of **companion planting**.

* Astrology and the telling of the future has long been a part of the Adenian society, but many saw the profession as pure bogus. Some sailors saw the starcharts of the Astrologers, and the formations in the sky, and saw their usefullness. The upper part of the sky was relatively static, even though it varied throughout the year, these variations were always cyclical. With soke study, and a little bit of help, a captain managed to make **Starmaps **(drawings of the sky in relation to positions on the planet, I.e north, south, east, west etc) to help him navigate the seas.

* **Large tart fruit with fibrous pits domestication** [what is that fruit anyways?] were domesticated in the colony. These, together with the ~~tomatoes~~ eggplant greatly helped with the food security of the colony.

* In larger cities sewage had long been collected by hand, by the poorest of people. This was time consuming, so we sought to ease the burden, and the money consumed by building **sewage ditches**, the sewage was thus collected, and then allowed to rot in a compost, (and become highly nutritious dirt). The **night soil** was then spread over the fields, to help increase the fertility of the turf.

* The cuisine of Aden was largely influenced by the neighboring Tao. This resulted in the importing of certain Tao vegetables such as the **onion**.

* Pandela escothen went to great effort to fortify the city of Gur Tzi, not only did she build a wall toward the mainland (based on the sea floor) but she also made the connecting bridge retractable. This was however a very rudimentary solution, and as the flow of goods increased, she sought a more permanent solution. So, she sought help from her most prominent scholars, and they came up with a solution, a bridge that could be lifted, a drawbridge. This however required strong ropes , to lift the bridge. It was widely known that metal (bronze and iron) were some of the strongest existing materials. So, a blacksmith came up with the idea of linking it into a **chain**. This strong ""rope"". However, as bronze was of scarce available, and very expensive, so Iron was imported (I have the equipment to work it) and made into a chain, with the help of a smith of Ashad. They also made a longer, larger chain that could be raised over the opening to the bay, in the event of a naval invasion.

STOCKHOLM: According to Nyhetsbyrån Direkt, Paradox wants to close its development studios in Malmö and Umeå to concentrate the Swedish operations in Stockholm. The decision, affecting 36 people, is not made for cost-saving reasons, according to the gaming company.

""We have reviewed our Swedish development organization and concluded that we want to focus development in Stockholm because we believe it will be better for our efficiency and productivity over time /.../ In both studios, there are very skilled people, but unfortunately, we see that the current setup is not the best for our long-term development,"" says Corporate & Financial Communications Manager Marcus Hallberg at Paradox to Nyhetsbyrån Direkt.

The closure plans affect approximately 5 percent of Paradox's total workforce.

""The decision is not motivated by macroeconomic trends or cost savings. The reason is our strategic direction, that we want to consolidate our development to fewer locations because we believe it will help us increase our productivity and give us better opportunities to grow,"" says Marcus Hallberg.

Paradox is now entering into union negotiations, and according to the company, the ambition is to make the change as good as possible for those who may be affected.

Is it your ambition to offer jobs in Stockholm to all 36 people?

""We will not open new positions in Stockholm as a result of our intention to close our operations in Malmö and Umeå. But our goal is to match our current open positions with the skills available in Malmö and Umeå, which is part of the process with our unions,"" says Marcus Hallberg.

Do you estimate that this measure will give rise to any particular costs such as severance pay, relocation support, or similar?

""We are early in the process, and this is, of course, part of our dialogue with our union counterparts. To the extent that such costs arise, they are likely to be limited because the change affects a limited part of the workforce.""

* Merchants travelling to Zefarri lands upon cart often noted that their roads were different from their own, simple, dirt roads. When Zefarri builders were asked to make a road between two villages, they built **Harrapan roads**, something that became widely spread in Aquitinian lands.

* A Zefarri builder was given the task to build a bridge, over a large river in Aquitinia. When local bulders saw his construction they were amazed. He had managed to span the river with a single arch, something that hadn't been accomplished by local builders. When they asked about his methods, he told them about the **True Arch**, which was capable of carrying larger loads.

* Upon visiting Epo-Kaan, an Emissary from the Aquitinian Garrum saw a construction site. The Zefarri were using a peculiar technique to reach the upper levels, they used **Scaffolding**. This method soon reached Aquitinia, and became more common as buildings grew taller.

* ~~An Aquitinian merchant travelling in ReeBokThanBaa noted that their carts were pulled not by slow oxen, but by faster donkeys, upon inquiry the Coachman gave the merchant the name of a Rewbok trader, selling these livestock. Soon enough, he brought the creatures to Aquitinia, and the market for them grew, as the more specialized donkeys were better at their job. As time passed, a substantial donkey population grew in Aquitinia, this led to local **Donkey domestication**.~~

* When an Aquitinia captain employed a Zefarri fisherman, the fisherman noted the lack of **Harpoons** on the boat. The Captain was very confused, as he did not know what a harpoon was. Soon enough, the Aquitinian captain was learned what a harpoon was, and how it worked, something he shared with fellow captains.

* Zefarri traders visiting Aquitinia often used carts to transport their goods. These carts were pulled by two cattled, held together with a **yoke**. The concept of the yoke was soon imported, together with the Zefarri goods.

##Culture/Concepts

* Upon dining with his Tao-Lei host, a Aquitinian merchant was surprised, when presented with two sticks, at the table. Upon reaching for his food with bare hands, he was abruptly corrected, and he soon learned to use **chopsticks** when eating. This, he brought home with him, a tradition that spread through the higher Aquitinian society. (Culture stuff, not tech.)

* When visiting the city of Lei-Fong-Dao, people often noted that its streets and waters were very clean, compared to Aqqo. Upon asking, the Messenger heard of the Night soil patrols. When he returned to Aquitinia, he suggested that a similar system should be used in Aqqo. **Street Cleaners** started to work the streets during the nights, and thus Aquitinia became a cleaner country, and fertilizer became more common. (I'm adopting the concept from them, as this doesn't count as tech)

#Natural

* ~~Through intricate studies of birds, and thorough experimentation on certain them, an Aquitinian scientist managed to tame the Tambourine Dove, and later, a Storm Petrel. These birds, he learned to carry letters, something they did happily for their master. **Bird taming (message carriers) [Tambourine dove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tambourine_dove) and [Oceanites oceanicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_storm_petrel)**~~

* An experienced Aquitinian potter noted that it was easier to shape the pot if it was rotating. After some thought, he constructed a **potters wheel** and tried it. This invention changed the potmaking proffession forever.


[This is for both weeks]




**Additions**

Diffused:

* Much interaction was had between the Zefarri, and the Aquitinian farmers. They often shared their methods for farming with each other, and irrigation techniques were some of them. Thus, Aquitinian farmers started using larger, more efficient **Canals** for irrigation. This lead to better irrigation, and larger harvests.

* Trade between Aquitinia and Tao-Lei has been consistent for centuries, and trade brings ideas with it. One of these ideas was **fertilizer**, take the manure from your cattle, and put it on your field, and voila!

Many younger hunters would take these opportunities to travel downstream, into greener lands where both animals and plants had had more time to warm up and flourish. Most of all, they wanted to get away from the dwindling stores of food and ever-increasing rations of meager river fish.

So it was that a group of four canoes, one from each of the nearby *metís*, each with lightly laden backpacks, were setting out and heading downriver. Eight they were, two in each canoe. Most young men, but at the helm of the party was one elder. Not only was he the right hand of the law-giver, but also one of the rare, highly-esteemed falcon-hunters in the area.

---

The first few days of the hunting expedition passed quickly. Some small game and fish were caught along the banks of the river, but no traces of larger game could be found. Yet, even so, spirits were high. Ilo and his falcon had been quite productive, bringing a small game in every day, a good omen for the journey.

On the morning of the sixth day however, when the group was traveling downriver Ilo lost sight the bird hovering somewhere above. At first, little heed was given to this, but when the river waters quickly began to rise, the speed of the stream increasing to a degree that it was frothing, they realized that they were fools not to have heeded the omen.

Over the next few hours, the river frothed, swelling over its banks carrying the group swiftly downstream. With the water so high and the stream so swift, attempting to leave the flow was dangerous, if not outright impossible, and as such they held to the center, using their paddles to keep the canoes stable. In this time they came much deeper down in the valley than even the elder had before.

Slowly the currents relinquished, and the party managed to come to shore, stowing their canoes and getting some much needed rest, cold and hungry. However, in the morning, a twofold surprise came. Ripples of smoke from a campfire somewhere in the distance - which they would decide to investigate - as well as the [falcon](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/junges-merlin-falco-columbarius-30972761.jpg) returning shortly after.

Learning from others has always been useful, as we all know, the Aquitinians are always out looking for new things.


The Zefarri have been using weapons of a strange material, this material is ~~copper~~ bronze. Thus after much trying and failing, we managed to use **Bronze Working** to create the much stronger metal.


After looking at Tao-lei methods of storing food, we managed to use **Wet brine food storage** using our previous salting methods.

After noting the weapons that the Zefarrian monks had, the Aquitinians tried replicating them, and ended up with **Hook Swords**.



~~After noting the weapons that the Tenebrae legundies wore, the Aquitinians thought, we could make these out of copper! And soon the newly built smithies of the country where overflowing with **copper weapons**.~~

**Natural techs**

The ingenuity of an Orlo led to the finding of the **Pickaxe** after he in his fury hacked at a stone, with his broken mallet.

When bringing larger amounts of fish, and trading with other peoples by sea, the need for more storage space on boats has been needed. Thus **Decks** have been created on the boats with storage space underneath.

~~An aquitinian boatbuilder noted that it was much easier to build boats when they where raised from the ground, he tried his idea, and after this he always used **raised boatbuilding**.~~

An orlo man, trying furiously to get his sled over rough terrain realized, that if you put axles and wheels on it, you could simply roll it over the obstacles (?). Thus he built a **Cart**.

The orlo, bristling with ideas came up with a new idea, for hunting animals, like an atlatl, but using a string, bound to a stick. This new invention allowed for more precise, and powerful shots. This weapon, made out of a single piece of wood, was the **Short bow**.

Seeking more effective ways of farming, the arsen tried out several new techniques, one they found effective was the **Slash and burn** technique. With this new method, they could provide more food for the Aquitinian nation, and also start exporting rice.

~~After the discovery of cold copper working, we realized that the only current source of copper we had, was gifts from foreigners. As this metal was superios to our current tools, we set out to find the precious metal. After a lot of searching, we found copper ore. Thus we started using **copper-annealing** to shape the copper.~~

~~When one fortunate Aquitinian made a mistake in his copper annealing and heated it too much, thus discovering **copper smelting**.~~

~~Using cold copper working, the gleaming pieces of metal quickly found their way into the hearts of the people, who started shaping it into **Copper jewelry**.~~

As the Aquitinians & Zefarri builders worked together, new methods spread into Aquitinia, among them, the **Corbel arch**.

As Aquitinian traders frequented Zefarri ports, they often saw their boats, and one day, a trader noted the slant of a mast, leading to the importation of the **Raked mast** into Aquitinia.

When Zefarri ships arrived in Aqqo, they often carried inventions of their own, entirely new to the Aquitinian boatbuilders, who often went down to the docks, to study these boats. One builder noted the **Jib Sail**, and soon put it into use, on his own boats.

In the more southern reaches of Aquitinia, the rice wouldn't grow, as the enviroment was less humid, and the ground was more arid. However, Zefarri farmers were growing a grain, that could grow in these areas, as time went on, **Tef** spread over the border, into Aquitinia.

In Zefarri lands, a machine similar to the Rice pounder was seen, it turned grains into a powder, only, a lot faster. Soon a **Grain Mill** could be found on many of the farms in the south, where teff was grown.

##Natural

As time went on, more and more discoveries were made on the sea, among them, was that water flowed, and that boats followed the current. Fishers who wanted to stay put, soon started fastening weights to ropes, and simply dropping them to the sea floor, to keep the boat still. Thus the **Anchor** came into use.

When going on the high seas, large waves often tipped boats, if they came from the side. The Boatbuilders fervently searched for a solution to the problem. After years of studyinh boats, a boatbuilder came up with the **Keel**, to finally put an end to the problem.

With the increasing amount of Agriculture in Aquitinia, and the ever larger cities, storage of rice, and teff soon became a necessity, thus **Granaries** were built, to keep vermin away, and store the food for longer amounts of time.

As larger boats were being built in Aquitinia, the builders realized that the size of the boat made the construction inconvenient, as lifting the boat was very hard. So they started raising the boats, to access it more easily, which in turn made building them less complicated. (**Raised Construction**)

These lands soon became united under the banner of Zod Menhu, the chosen emperor of Zara.

In the secluded lands of the Semer-Khet, many villages were raided and burned, and some of the less brave lordlings subjected themselves to pay tribute to the Zhana empire. The Zod ruled the lands briefly, until fierce guerilla fighters drove them from the valleys, but some of the larger cities payed protection money for several decades after, and often referred to Menhu as their superior.

In the faraway lands of the Yataya, these raiders started to show themselves, pillaging and burning, and the few existing leaders soon subjected themselves to foreign rule, to avoid a gruesome death. These would soon find their place in the grand puzzle of Zod Menhu's plans.

The northern Kelashi were quickly swept away by the tidal wave of riders coming south, unable to raise their armies, they quickly surrendered to the rule of the Zod and found themselves living in the lands of Tek. When news reached the southern Kelashi, they valiantly sailed north to save their brethren, and their superior naval experience led to the exodus of thousands, to the dismay of Menhu. He did however forbid people to leave on their own, and set men to guard the major ports.

However, as the Kelashi had fallen, the Malaran did as well. Shattered in their internal wars, they fell to the wave of invaders as wheat falls before the hoe.

With these massive tracts of lands under his banners, he continued to ride south, and eventually stumbled upon the Pendashi and their cities. As he saw their lands, he thought to himself:

They will bow, like all the others.

---

The results from the first part would be:

* The Kelashi lose their northern province to Menhu, and migrates many of its people, a majority is however not plausible, as a province is around 1,000,000 people. **I do however think that you should get 1 province (the eastern one) from an influx of refugees, and population growth. You also loose your northern province.**

* The Semer-Khet fought valiantly against the invaders, eventually repelling them, they get the domestication of **horses** as a free tech, however, these will take time to come in great numbers, and will not be greatly useful in these mountainous lands. Also, occupation comes at a price, the Semer-Khet will get **2 less techs** during the century, as a result of the chaos and economical strain.

* The Malaran swiftly fell to Zod, and are no more, those who survived now serve him in the form of vassals, as the Malaran **declaimed**.

* The Yataya will suffer severe penalties, as their government was unable to respond to the invasion, this century they will get **5 less techs** and suffer a complete change of government, as well as severe civil disorder, making them **incapable of major efforts, such as war, or larger explorations** for the century. They are also **Vassals of the Tek Empire**. (Large parts of these penalties can be removed when a proper responce is given, if not, these remain.)

The second part is quite small, only the Kelashi are affected, as the Semer-Khet have fullfilled their part, and all the others have been occupied or worse.

This became more clear in Hooshmon, where the two peoples met. Although the Mandar government made clear that this was none of their doing, and that they only desired peace. When Tenebrae settlements would draw near to the coast, a vengeance of burning arrows would come out of the dark sea, and set them alight. Small grudges grew to feuds, and this would, at times result in larger confrontations.

Not all of those who lived in hooshmon were hostile to each other, and relations between the two peoples were not entirely uncommon. Though this often resulted in the pair being disowned by both their families. As time progressed, small settlements sprung up, not associating themselves with either people, these called themselves the Hooshmon, a people, friendly to both Aquitinians and Tenebrae.

* Amerio Henko Latefo: He wants to create an Aquitinian army, because as of now  (he says) that Aquitinia is a big juicy target for raiders and invaders. He wants to change that.

*  Onero Heno: This Orlo man is unique. Never before has an Orlo been a candidate, but due to his immense popularity, he has been allowed to participate. He wants to invest in new things, improve the nation in other areas, agriculture, and animal kinship.


Now you might be asking yourself, how can i affect the outcome? 
The answer is, that rich people are greedy. There are two ways. Either you can send a delegation, to honour one of the candidates, and make him more popular. Or use bribes to affect the voters. Your choice! (I will only have an event like this every 100/200 years, to make stuff simple)."

* The House of Lords, where all the major lieges would sit (about 10)

* The House of Scholars, and Merchants, where 5 learned, and 5 merchants would be chosen.

* Through the years, the waters close to the large cities had slowly become less... *fishable*. The amount of fish was simply decreasing, and the ever growing population needed more food. Small secrets came to the country, often to be put in some corner, and forgotten. One lucky summer day, a merchant dusted off his bookshelf, and found an old drawing of Dao-Lei **Trawling nets**. This soon became a new source of wealth for the merchant.

* In the old lands of Aquitinia, a crop had been grown. This crop was **~~Tef~~ flax**, highly useful for making textiles and linen, something that was used often in the making of sails. Textiles were often imported from the Ashad, but after a year of storms, and sunken ships, it was decided to start growing this crop once more, to have a small secure stash of textiles near at hand, at all times.

* Many ships were built in Aden, but the deforestation took its toll on the lands. The cities were having a hard time bringing in wood for the building of ships, and the labourous process of bringing the goods to the docks was making boatbuilding very expensive. A few  Enli with a peculiar interest for botanical life made a very interesting observation. Trees can be sown much like rice, and other crops. As they started applying this knowledge **Rambutan planting** spread over the lands, reviving long gone forests surprisingly close to the cities.

* The region around the cities were starting to produce large amounts of excess goods. These goods needed to be transported to the harbours, to be shipped to foreign lands. The stubby wheels of old had never been built upon, and were very inefficient. The enli now began to use something widely known across the world. They bent a piece of wood around spokes. This gave a better wheel, and also saved on the wood used in the process. Thus **Spoked wheels** were stuck to carts, and new things rolled into action. 

* ~~A large part of the economy was the trade that the merchants of Aden conducted. This trade brought great sums of money into the country. By now, the trading had gone on for centuries, and the knowledge of trading grew larger. The wealthy merchants soon started small companies that traded more specific goods, on more specific routes. As these captains of old now sat in their armchairs at home, they had time to improve their methods. This resulted in the development of **Rudimentary finances**, something that soon spread to the government, whom started to exact a small tax upon the goods traded.~~"

So, we looked outside our city, and soon found a solution to our problem, in the form of the **backstrap loom**. This greatly helped our society, and will continue helping it, throughout time.

* As we retrieved, and exported ever larger amounts of goods, we needed to use manpower even more effectively. By combining several pullies, one man could slowly but surely lift many times his own weight. The succesful **advanced pullies** added yet another trinket, to our pile of mechanisms.

* Through ages of fighting, we found out one thing, our heads are very vulnerable. However, we had never sought to protect them (very strange). This flaw among our soldiers lead to many casualties and wounds. Now we were revolutionizing out fighters with padded, customized pots. Thus, **[helmets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrian_type_helmet)** were introduced.

* As we soon found out, the metal called iron is a **LOT** cheaper than bronze, and as we didn't have any local sources of metal (yet) we had to rely on imported goods. But, we also wanted to make our own tools, and form the iron in our city. We couldn't do this, with our current methods, but with some investigation, we found out that **bloomeries** were the key to smelting iron. So, we brought this method to our home. (also, buying iron is cheaper than buying tools, and pure iron takes less space.)

* As our merchants visited the Ashad-Naram, we saw them burning a dark substance, black like pitch, but solid. Upon asking, we were told that this substance was called **Charcoal**, and burned much better than regular wood, however it needed to be processed. After some bartering, and a reduced price on some slaves, we were showed the process. This must surely come in handy.

* **Dirt roads**, as the war with Tenebrae started raging, the Aquitinians soon realized that their infrastructure was lacking, and  that transportation was slow, even over the flat plains of Aquitinia, so, they started clearing roots, stones and grass from routes with heavy traffic, and transport of food, and other goods became much easier.

* **Ditch Irrigation** with the increasing amount of farmers living in the Aquitinian inland, new methods of farming became more common. Rice farmers soon became aware that the rice required water to grow, and that watering fields was very tiring, so they started digging ditches, in which water was led to more arid parts of the fields.

* In the northern premises of the country, a plant known as rattan was discovered, and cheriched because of the way it let itself bend, and still be able to carry weight. As it became more commonly used, in baskets, furniture, and even as roofs in the drier areas, people started making their living, through **Rattan domestication**.

We had long studied the stars and the sky, to predict our future, and keep our time. We learned things about the sky, the sea of God himself. In this sea, some said lived the souls of our ancestors, great people of times past.

There were the settled, the twinkling stars that came back time, and time again, always in the same place, content with their spot on the sea of darkness.

There were the restless, the few who ever roamed the seas, following some ancient will of their own. They shone brighter than any star, and moved on the sky. (planets)

There were the visitors, who would shine bright on the sky for a few days or weeks, but then fade away, and not be seen for decades, or even centuries. Like the wanderers, these came back time, and time again, but their absences were much longer. (these would be comets)

Then there were the messengers as some called them, shooting stars on the sky that would come once, and once only, these souls left their place on the sea, and were bound to fall, and ultimately drown, their lights winking out from existence.

By the end of the last moon, a strange thing happened, a light pierced the night sky, burning incredibly bright. Some thought it to be a new star rising to existence, but the star burned for seven days and nights, only to flicker out of existence a week later. Accompanying this bright star, the red wanderer travelled the skies, eclipsing the star at a point.

The meaning of this was debated among the astrologists, but they soon came to a conclusion. Hard times were ahead, wether it was 7, 70 or 700 years, they all came to the same conclusion.

A new star has appeared in our sky, and this time, it has stayed. Many say that this is a sign of hope in the dark times ahead, others say it signifies the birth of a savior to our people, a person to lead us through the peril."

Great battles had sent the Island into a great depression, both technologically, and economically but war had its positives.

We learned several things from the war, amongst these the building of great warships. Our enemies had used **early dromons** with **rams** and now we would have these as well.

To our dismay we found that mining on our little island is very hard, with few iron resources available (if you dig down, you find water, and there are no hills to speak of). We did however find a sand on our shores, that looked distinctly like the ore that would be found in the ground. 

However, if put into normal iron furnaces the iron produced would be of so low quality that it couldn't be worked. This spelled the end of Adenian iron production - until the war started. The Southerners would sink our iron ships, and we needed the material sorely. This forced us to invent. During the first year of the war, seveal ironless smiths were given the iron sand, and payed to experiment, to produce iron at (nearly) all costs. So, they came up with the **[tatara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatara_(furnace))**. The process was long, and expensive but provided us with a steady supply of native iron, and thus gave us a headstart in the war.

During the war we also noted several useful fortifications our enemies used, such as the **double-filled walls**. These would help protect some of the inland cities, where water for moats could not be easily found.



As the lords were discussing the peace treaty, they were served wine in exquisite **glass** cups. The Adenians grew fond of the see-through material, and decided that they wanted it for themselves. Since the Aden-AlBakku trade was very uncertain, a craftsman was bribed, and soon gave away his secrets.



During the war, the Adenians fought on horseback for the first time. Their horses were only ""armored"" with a rider on top, and this made them very vulnerable targets once they stopped. Thus they made the first **horse armour** for those important enough to afford it.

During modern battles many used metal armor for protection, this gave sharp weapons a severe disadvantage. As a smith was attacked by an armored enemy, he swung his hammer (for shaping iron) and hit the soldier dead in his chest. The poor sod died from a broken ribcage, and in one moment both the **flail** and the **warhammer** were born. These weapons were slow and heavy, but when they struck true their targets were dead meat.

During the war several new methods for armouring soldiers in iron had been used, among them **scale armour** which had proven very succesful. As the scales were both flexible and strong.

Several brigands, inexperienced with bows had rigged their bows up to a plank, where the string could be fastened, and then released at any moment to send the arrow flying towards their enemy with great speed and accuracy."

When trading with the other nations of the hegemony (mainly Zefarri and Tao-Lei) the Aquitinian traders discovered the usefullness of the dhin, a **currency** used within the hegemony. The currency quickly spread throughout the nation, and is now considered the national currency.

When the northern Aquitinians started to interact with the Tenebrae, they soon realised that they often wrote their letters on **Rice paper** instead of carving them on clay/stone tablets. As the production of rice in Aquitinia increased, excess rice was soon made into paper.

When arriving in Zefarri harbors, the Aquitinians often saw small ships, with clinker hulls, held together not by nails, but by wood. This cheaper method of building (small) boats was soon imported to Aquitinia, and boats with **Sewn hulls** were being built.

**Natural Techs**

With the ever increasing size of major Aquitinian cities (such as Aqqo), the Aqla saw fit to build the city in a more organized way. Thus they started using **Urban Planning**, and tidying up the mess that the cities had become.

When searching for a way to make stronger masts and generally ship building materials, the shipbuilders came up with an idea, with layered masts, a stretchy material could be used in certain areas and rigid materials in other places. Thus they came up with **Lamination**.

When seeking a way to improve the kiln, to reach higher temperatures, an orlo potter came up with a new design, the **~~bottle~~ beehive kiln** which was capable of reaching staggering temperatures, and creating new sorts of pottery.

~~When seeking a way to improve the short bow, an orlo huntsman visiting Aqqo saw one of the new methods of making masts, lamination. He then realised that this method could be used to make better bows, thus resulting in **composite bows** that were still easy to carry around, but powerful enough to shoot far.~~

~~Using the new kiln that he had made, the potter realised that the high firing temperatures could harden new sorts of clay. With this in mind, he bought different sorts of clay, and tried them out, combining them, and using the very best of his skills. When combining Kaolin clay, and Ball clay, and putting them in his new kiln, he got something he had never seen before. The pot that now stood before him, was very hard, white, and strong. The material he had got was **Porcelain**, something that would completely change his ways of potmaking, and open a completely new world.~~

~~When experimenting with outriggers, an Aquitinian shipbuilder realized, that instead of leaving empty space between the two boats, a deck could be built, allowing for a mast, and a lot more cargo to be carried, but still allowing for a stable **catamaran**.~~

**My Character is** a technomancer from Sweden, Gothenburg that has grown up in a corporate family and surrounded by tech. She was one of the first to experience the new wireless matrix when it launched, as the Wireless Matrix Initiative came there first. She delved into hacking due to her curiosity and boredness and got tracked after her first proper run. She fled to Seattle to start over, without the local corporates making her life hell. Loki is quite curious and likes to explore new things all the time. This is one of the reasons she has turned to shadowrunning, there are always new and exciting things happening.

**Lokis goals** are first and foremost to explore the matrix, get to know the world and meet new and interesting people. Then, if it is possible later on to get some revenge on those who forced her to flee. Money is of course a nice addition.

**I want to play Loki** to get into the world of Shadowrun, I have Gm:d it IRL (very little) as I am quite interested in it. I'd also like to get the chance to roleplay more, since I enjoy it a lot.

The Ainúri had been subject to raids from their southeastern neighbors, and had subsequently started to surround their settlements with palisades. They had met new people to the north, and learned from them.

###*Diffused Tech*

During the years, the Ainúri encountered several peoples in the surrounding area. Among these were the Valisani, living further up the Déon river. Along with the Valisani, were found some so far [unnamed indigenies](https://www.reddit.com/r/DawnPowers/comments/5r8636/going_up_the_river/) wearing face masks.

From these indigenies we learned of the **Olive**. A fruit nice and oily, tasty when prepared in the appropriate way. These fruits had hard seeds inside, and after some were left outside the village - along with the rest of the waste, they started to grow. Thus, we saw our first olive trees, these bore more olive fruits, which were then similarly replanted.

As the Gedokosza preferred knocking women unconscious and kidnapping these. Something we adopted from the nearby tribe to try to stop it were their facemasks. Concealing our faces made the female fighters harder to discern from their male counterparts.

The southern menace, raiders, rapists and robbers the whole lot. Evil men incapable of anything but violence we thought, but it seems that they have their own techniques and ways of doing things. From them we learned of the **sling**, capable of slinging deadly rocks far and wide. Even though they are not as useful for hunting as the bow, as they bruise the meat, we adopted them to counter the Gedokosza's own slingers, slightly outranging our own archers.

Other things we noticed about the Gedokosza was that they used the sinew of animals to **sew** together larger pieces of skin, making far better clothes. They also used sharp bones to sew. This we adopted, using the skin and bones of seals and fish, to sew together better fitting clothes for our people, but instead of using sinew, we would use linen string made from flax.

###*Innovative Technologies*

In the swamps of the central Ainúri lands, clay was readily available. Simple pottery made for good containers for fresh water, fish, grain and other foods. Thus, their use was universal. The **Pottery Wheel** came as a product of this, among the many potters in the land, one man had the idea, and it spread like wildfire. It revolutionized the art of pottery, making it far easier, and far more efficient.

The Canoe was one of the most versatile watercrafts of the time, capable of quickly traveling up and down the rivers, and to a limited extent travelling on the sea itself. The fact that they were so common made advances in canoebuilding spread quickly, and came once or twice in so long. Thus, the building of **Advanced Canoes** came to be, they could be longer, sturdier and more streamlined. The canoe was one of the most versatile modes of transportation, a group of six paddlers could achieve a speed of three knots on calm waters. And, the team could, due to the lightness of the boat, carry it together with their gear.

Wood rots. Wood burns. Wood dries. This is the nature of wood. In some areas however, materials like mud and clay were available to all, not just the select few who collected it for their pots. One day, one young genius had the idea, as he watched a pot drying in the sun. The pottery doesn't burn, it doesn't rot, and the drying helps it. Thus **Mud Bricks** came to be. They held long for permanent structures, and did not burn when the raiders came. This made them incredibly loved.

The widespread use of pottery and mud bricks made people think. Pots dried in the sun. Why did they dry? The heat of the sun dried them. How could this be made quicker? A fire?  As pots and bricks could not be held above the fire, lest they fall to pieces, one would instead force the heat to stay with them, much the same way one had a fire in his home to warm it. Thus came the **Pit Kiln**, a convenient way to quickly dry larger amounts of pottery and mudwork.

Those who lived by the sea fished fish, and showered themselves in fresh and salt water. The fish however did not last forever, they rotted, they smelled, they became uneatable. One day, a fisher noticed a fish in his boat that had been there for quite a while, it had not rotted. It was lying in a small pool of salt water, so he tried the trick on other fish that he had caught. It worked, his method of **Saline preservation** meant a lot. The people could now securely keep their fish and vegetables for longer periods of time, not only relying on grain for long term food security.

As the populus of the Ainúri territories grew, trade became more and more prevalent. This did however create some disputes. How much grain was a particular salesman selling for a certain amount of fish? There was a simple solution. Measuring the amount that each brought to the bargain. It was however hard to check how much grain a sack contained, so instead one would measure its weight. At first, the unreliable method of testing by hand was used, but this quickly led to anger. Instead, the **Scale** came to be. An easy way of comparing the weight of two objects.

The Ainúri traveled out to sea a lot, to fish mostly. However, if one travelled far out to fish, it could take quite a while to get back, and manuevering a boat in the dark was hard. Instead, people took to checking the time, but a persons sense of time could be unreliable. Instead, the **Sundial** came to be.

Wedding, food and bedding. All that nice jazz.

[Long version]

###Pre-Wedding Lore

There were lots of new people in New Barrel, many kids around, Addam was quite certain that Arlan had lots of good company, but he made sure to have Martyn keep an eye out anyways. He himself was getting ready for his impending wedding.

Addam donned his finest clothes for the occasion, his face cleanly shaven, except for the small beard on his chin. He checked himself in the mirror, and smiled.

That morning, the wedding breakfast had been held. Nothing too big, nothing too dramatic, some gifts had come his way. Most had enjoyed the meal, the mulled wine had warmed them all up, while bacon and eggs had settled in their stomachs. Lots of jokes had been going around the table, the men laughing and having fun. He had also heard that the women's breakfast had been enjoyable.

Everything had been arranged, the ceremony, the feast, and the celebrations. All in all it was an expensive affair, but he had been feeling generous. He had been saving up a good amount of gold, and piles of money were never of any help to anyone. The food would be splendid, he knew.

Everything was ready, everything was done. He headed to the sept.

##The Wedding

This wasn't his first time marrying, but it had been a long time. He was dressed in the finest of clothes, with the [Green and Yellow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UYuAr4Ng0) of house Fossoway. He soon took his place at the front of the sept, standing between the mother and father, the septon with him. The rows were filled with people, both high and low. The Lords and Ladies settled toward the front, with the gentry towards the back and some out in the cold beyond the doors of the sept.

As musicians started playing, Sheia Fossoway, the Bride was slowly coming towards the altar. She was a beautiful young lady, and his own hair was beginning to gray. Nevertheless, they were about to be wedded. A cold breeze caught in her maidens cloak, and it lifted slightly, before once more settling about her.

A smile was on her face, whether real or not, he would not worry about. Her escort consisted of Grance, the Lord of Cider Hall, as well as her father. 

The septon said the holy words, and before long they were exchanging their vows, his voice, one of a Lord: ""*I am hers, and she is mine. From this day, until the end of my days.*"" and hers, one of Beauty... ""*I am his, and he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days.*""

The septon was happy, all the incantations and recitals had been fulfilled. He cleared his voice and called out loudly: ""From this moment forward, Addam and Sheia of House Fossoway are declared husband and wife. Their vows declared in front of Gods and men, may their union endure beyond such time as the oceans swallow the land, and the stars rain down from the heavens.""

He unfastened the ceremonial cloak, yellow, with a green apple and draped it over her shoulders. It was not all that different from her maidens cloak, the only difference being the color of the apple.

And now it was time to ""Kiss the bride"" he embraced Sheia and gave her an affectionante kiss. He knew he would never be the man of her dreams, but he was a good man, and he would be a good husband. He made sure she would like the kiss, he had some skill in the art of kissing.

###The Feast

The Great Hall of New Barrel was filled to the brim, a loud din of talking and laughter blanketed the air. Servants started flowing into the hall, with steaming dishes of lamb, venison and other tasty foods on the plates. Not only were there stews and roots, but also sweet breads many different sorts. Every man and woman could have their fill of New Barrel Cider, but there was also arbour red and several mulled wines to heat up the conversations. For dessert there were pies, lots of pies, dates and different arrangements of exotic fruits. There was however one last dish, Frozen apples in steaming whipped cream with a taste of vanilla. And so, the feast began.

The thought had long been growing in his mind, but a recent discussion with his sister Mira a short while ago had finally made him decide. He was going to write a letter to a few of the houses that were closely related to the Fossoway house.

>Lords Jon Ashford, Osmund Footly and Grance Fossoway

>I write to you all now as I feel that we should come together and discuss a certain matter. The smaller houses in the Reach stand for a  significant amount of its forces - but get little credit and reward for them. We are stood upon by the mighty few who use us to reap all the rewards for themselves they share the cake. We get merely crumbs - or nothing. I think this should be changed. Our houses may be tiny compared to the larger ones, but as a whole we match them. We should band together and make sure that we get the recognition that we deserve. As the political landscape of the Reach has recently changed due to the war, I think it would be prudent to use the opportunity to bring several of our smaller houses together - in an alliance of sorts.

>Therefore I propose a meeting of sorts in either one of our keeps within the coming year, to discuss how we would do such a thing.

He chomped on the loaf of fresh baked bread as he walked towards the citadel. It was surprisingly far from Dyannes merchant house to the entrance of the Citadel, but he had gotten used to making the trek every day, either by foot or by horse. Aemund was occupied by his mind as he walked, hardly noticing the time that went by. His thoughts went back and forth. The black candles were legendary, said to have great power, but none had burned in living memory. None had managed to use them for a long, long time. He would have a *full night* with *three* of the buggers, and unlike most other maesters he had several valyrian steel links. He had pondered whether to top off with a black iron link of War craft or magic and occult. He settled for a valyrian link. Besides, they looked really shiny on the maesters that had them, and he was the brightest student in a long time.

He found himself right outside the citadel, beside the scribes den and those same two gargoyles that had greeted him the first time he [Came to the Citadel](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronThronePowers/comments/5frvlt/event_coming_to_the_citadel/).

He entered. Several hours of pondering, reading and thinking later he had a plan. He was going to be great, the first maester in centuries to light one of the candles. He had a plan. He had memorised some of the most crucial information and practiced some of the things he would do. Darkness was falling over the citadel, and he was escorted by a group of maesters to the room of the vigil. One said to him ""...and whatever you do, don't try to light the fucking candles, they can't be lit. Besides, you'll cut yourself."" Aemund nodded patiently to himself, thinking 'Yes, that's what they all say. 

They opened a door, and he entered, light onto the three obsidian candles, reflecting off their surfaces. He took a seat before them, and someone said ""Good luck"" before the door slowly ground shut.

Aemund took a deep breath, and prepared himself for a long night, should the attempt fail. First, he waited two hours, and only started once he had had a little rest before actually getting to work on them."

It was the beginning of a new era. The enemy to the south was growing, some the Ainúri were traveling the seas more and more in search of fish and others were settling further inland, farming the land. But humans, we have a strange trait quite unique to ourselves. The things we learn, we pass on to our children, and they pass on to their children.

###Innovative Techs

During the second part of the 6th millenia ""BCE"" the Ainúri learned of mud bricks, and advanced their potmaking. During they also began painting masks with dyes, and doing similar things. During the early 5th century, some potters began to apply the art of painting to the pots. The dyes would be applied after the first firing, so that it had a proper surface to stick to. Pictures and art were painted on these pots. In this increase of potmaking came the **pottery wheel**, a more advanced version of the tournette, spinning faster and making the potmaking both quicker and easier.

The use of kilns for firing pots inspired some to use them to make **fired bricks** which were much more resistant to both the weather and humidity that could be found in some areas of the Ainúri lands.

As the utilization of fired pottery increased - and some villages started to grow, the use of kilns increased dramatically. The pit kiln was however - awkward to say the least. Its reusability was limited and it left a lot to be desired in the quality of the bricks. They were at best shaped stones. Thus, some started to experiment with the kilns, having the kiln raised, which allowed air to flow in from below. Some even made more permanent kilns, **Beehive kilns** that could be reused often and much for both high quality pottery and good, sturdy bricks.

Some farmers had started to make business purely from planting and growing flax for linen clothes. It was harder to grow and manage than the hemp, but made for what  many called ""Better fabric"". These larger plantations combined their farming with larger scale weaving, making linen cloth from the flax. The backstrap loom did good, but with time, better methods of weaving evolved and the [**Warp-weighted loom**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp-weighted_loom#History) became more commonly used.

With the growth of agriculture amongst the Ainúri fields became larger and stretched ever further from the fertile lands of the rivers. The land here was drier, so at first they had used ditches to take the water from the rivers to the fields. Now however they had grown even further away and thus the ditches became larger, until they more resembled proper **irrigation canals** than simple ditches.

The Ainúri would travel ever further from the coast in search of fish, but the waves became larger and more dangerous, occasionally causing boats to capsize. Some solved this by adding outriggers - logs that were attached to the plank boats at some distance. These would however come in the way of nets as they were hauled onto the boat, or down into the water. **Keels** became a more common solution to the problem, as experimenting sailors came up with the elegant solution. These also allowed for **lift nets** to be used from boats. Those lacking the keel would simply capsize under the weight.

With more fishing came more nets. A net that could be lowered into the water (much like the hand held dip net) was derived. It was known as a **lift net** that could easily be lowered into the water from a plank boat with a keel, and used to catch larger amounts of fish. 

###*Stolen Tech*

As the Gedokosza continued to raid the Ainúri countryside, the Ainúri continued to defend themselves. One time, an entire group of the attackers were dispatched, and some **Cattle** were found grazing by their camp. With the help of a captured nomad, the village began to cultivate these animals. In much the same way, he learned the way of **Fermentation** to the Ainúri, then, in time he was allowed to return to his own lands, with a pack of food and shiny new clothes.

###3750 BCE

###Innovative Tech

The telling of stories was a large part of the Ainúri culture, Illúvatar and the creation of the world was among the greatest. Potmaking continued throughout the lands, and every respected family made sure to have some decoration on their pots. Distinguished potmakers had begun to mark their pots with carvings - to signify that they had made them, while others began to decorate them with stories in the form of **Pictograms**. As such, some stories had become written, with accompanying the stories on the pots.

As larger nets were used on the larger wooden boats, paddling them to and from the shore at ever larger distances became heavy. One day a fisher noticed a piece of clothing, fluttering from a line as it dried. The wind was catching it. So, he tried something. He made a primitive **Sail** by using a friend to hold a cloth stretched out on the windy beach. Soon enough, a gust of wind picked up and started pulling them away. After some thought and some trial and error he managed to install such a sail on his own boat, and used several ropes to adjust it and a paddle at the back to steer.

More heat means more fire means more heat means more throughput. This was the reasoning of the owner of a beehive kilns in the central Ainúri lands. During his time of playing with fire as a small kid (which he for naught tried convincing his own kids not to do) he had noticed that fanning fires with air made them burn more and hotter. After a while of thinking and crafting he came up with the **Bellows**, highly useful for his kiln.

As an advancement on the handling of several kinds of metal, **Annealing** was discovered. [Jewelry](https://www.reddit.com/r/DawnPowers/comments/5wgtvi/my_shiny_little_bead/) had become commonplace in the Ainúri lands, either as necklaces or beads or as more expensive adornement of masks. The metals found occasionally were sometimes worked by people. One time, someone had the idea to use an oven to heat the metal  up, thus making it easier to shape. This was noticed and the idea was improved upon, leading to more beautiful and intricate metalwork.

~~The Ainúri would along the rivers and sea catch shrimp, mussels and other sea animals. One day, a ""brilliant"" young mind had the idea to stick the shell from a muzzle into his fathers kiln. Thus, **quicklime** was first found. It was quite a useful material, luckily for the boy, and his father made a fortune selling it.~~

As herbs and plants were gathered from the forests for dyemaking, the Ainúri became more aware of the plants that were there. This lead to **herbalism** becoming quite common knowledge and saw widespread use in different areas such as ""medicine"", tasty beverages etc. It added a seasoning to the pallet as well, with parsley and other plants being used.

~~**honey preservation**~~


###*Stolen Tech*

When Gedokosza raiders had been in the Ainúri lands, they had used a technique to mark their tracks known as **Trailblazing**. Some locals picked the idea up and it spread throughout the lands.

In much the same way that cattle had been found and domesticated in the previous century, the **Hand Saw** came to the Ainúri lands. The occasional captive would share or be forced to share their knowledge that could help the Ainúri. Sometimes this yielded results, like this time.

He had asked her to be back soon, and she had given him a smile, and said ""I'll say hello as often as I can."" Every time she came by, he hugged her and asked her to stay longer this time, which she had done those times she visited. He still missed mommy badly.

He had made some new friends, Othello, who liked fighting with wood swords, Aemund, who liked learning new things, and Mallory, who just liked talking.

Then there was Addam, the lord.

When mom left, it was just Addam and him in the highborn quarters, and he had asked: ""Can I call you dad now? Since you're taking care of me?""

Arlan smiled ""All right grandfather""

There was so much to learn!

One day Arlan found grandfather in his workroom, fussing over son books, scribbling a little, here and there.

He walked up to him, and asked: ""What are you doing gramps? What are those books?""

It had only taken him a little while to realize that the long and unwieldy word ""Grandfather"" could be shortened to ""Gramps"" without any problems. There was a lot of text and numbers in the book, calculations.

It seemed like an eternity until gramps finally looked up.

""I'm doing the bookkeeping Arlan. It's about economy, how to handle coin.""

""Coin"" was the stuff you payed with, so this had to be about the running of the hold fast. It was important, he realized, but was still curious to know how it worked.

""Can you show me how?""

His grandfather answered: ""Arlan, my boy, have I ever denied you that?""

Arlan smiled. It was true, he always explained I Arlan asked him. They even played a little game. Each evening, Arlan would ask him to tell something he had never told before, and he always came with something new.

The three girls, Jaena, Jayne and Adelayde were given the night together. They usually were quite good at entertaining themselves, and this would not prove to be an exception.

Early in the evening they sat by the fire, and had a servant tell them stories. Then, they read the stories themselves, talking, looking at the pictures, fantasizing.

""Imagine a world"" Jaena began,

""Like in the stories"" Jayne continued

""With knights and princesses""

Kings and princes, dragons and evil warlords. A world where magic followed the wishes and whims of sorcerers, wizards and witches. A world, where the stories came true. In this world there was a mighty kingdom! A kingdom of apples green and red, king and queen ruling in prosperity, three princesses they had, each one more beautiful than the last, but no sons.  Kings and princes, knights and royals came from all around, vying for the hands of each of the beauties. But none loved them for who they were, and they all refused their suitors. There did however come one knight, fairer and kinder than all the rest. Yet, he was not of noble birth, and the king would not let them marry. 

Yet now a dragon came, and took the three princesses away. They were stuck together in a tower, guarded by the fierce dragon. The king decreed that the man who could find either one of his three beloved daughters and rescue her could have her hand in marriage. Many knights and princes took on the challenge, but all except one faltered at the sight of the mighty dragon. He fought the dragon bravely, and defeated him. He climbed the tower, and found not one, but three princesses. They all three leapt onto the knight, having fallen in love with him. Each one of the princesses gave him a kiss, one after the other.

They paused. ""How does it feel to kiss?"" one of the girls asked, the other two replied almosin unison, ""I don't know'"". There was a long pause before any of the girls spoke. It was Jaena who broke the silence, ""'I want to know"" she said.

A few moments later, the girls were all giggling furiously. ""That was odd""

At that time, Addam opened the door, all three girls blushed as a heap of drawings fell off the bed, princes, castles knights and dragons, all in a big mess on the floor. They all stopped when they saw his grave expression. ""You need to come"" he said.

They had finally arrived, she was home - in Westeros. She smiled for the first time in days, in the city there would be plenty of food to go around in the city.

She eyed the deck and the  pier to which the ship was anchored.  The sailors soon left the ship to roam the local pubs. She carefully climbed out, causing as little sound as possible and snook to the door of the captains cabin. 

The lock on the door was hardly a challenge for her, and it soon clicked open. She grinned as she pocketed the silver that lay on the desk and after a few moments if digging through papers she found what she was searching for. 

She was lucky to have been picked up by V'hag when her parents had died. It was a repayment for a debt to her mother, but what it was he never told. He had taught her everything she knew, climbing, swimming, killing , charming, reading, talking. They had travelled the east together. Lys, Braavos, Mereen, she had seen them all, though some she was too young to remember.

Then, he had died, ""His past had caught up to him"", and she was no longer safe. She would have to make it on her own in the cruel world, despite her young age. He had given her a coin and a location of a friend in Braavos, and had her climb down the balcony. His dying screams was what finally made her leave.

That was an entire year ago, the coin had gone to the ship that had lead her to a burnt out husk if a house, and a burnt skeleton piled up in the entrance.  She had lived on the streets since then, doing the occasional chore, cutting the occasional purse. 

Now, she headed out of the room, shut the door and left the ship via the gangplank. ""Oy! Watcha doin 'ere 'lil lass?"" 

She had been so lost in thought that she hadn't seen the guard on the pier. Stupid little girl thought, V'hag would be disappointed. 

When the guard grabbed her, she stuck a knife in his throat and moments later he was slowly sinking through the water. Noone would notice a missing guard. She wiped her dagger, and tucked it away again. She felt a little sorry for the man, *but this is a dog eat dog world.*

The man gave a toothy grin, ""So yuu cam le'a, got dem paps?"", she smiled, she never told anyone her real name, to them she was just a little thief. She waved the roll of parchment alluringly in front of him, and he reached to grab it. She took it just out of his reach, and offered her other hand, ""Money comes first"", 'never trust a pirate', they said. The mans smile faded, and he grumbled as he forked over the shiny, golden coin. She dropped the parchment on the table, turned around and walked away.

In roughly two months, the rich merchant vessel would be returning from Lys with a shipment of silk and the finest whores to fit in them. There would be a bravoosi ship with black sails waiting for them in Massey's hook.

Adelayde was sorry for the captain. He was a good man and he would die. Yet, she had food and lodgings for quite a while.

Lord Arlan and Lady Alyssa came into the room a bit after the rest of the guests, and seated themselves at the head of the high table.

After this the food was served. First were the appetizers, fruit, vegetables cheese and meat, all arranged into particularly *appetizing* arrangements. After this came the main courses, where there was Venison, mushroom stews, steaks and salads. For the dessert one could find the Frozen Apple combo, popular since last time, in small amounts, as well as lemon pies, raspberry tarts, confectories and cakes in abundance.

When the appetizers had been finished, music started to permeate the hall, dancers coming and going on the floor."

Initially Aemund had been a stranger to the environment in the Citadel. But, after a while he had gotten used to it, the atmosphere of a larger city and the constant bustling of people. One thing he had not gotten used to was people. Whenever someone adressed him, he would either grow red like a tomato, or simply stutter without words. 

There was however a group of novices that had accepted him for who he was, a studious young boy without any social skills.

And he did study, a lot. As a matter of fact he nearly spent the entire first month studying. Economy was an interesting subject, and he also had an object of study at his disposal. His grandfather never denied him access to the papers of Fossoway C&B, and through the last year, he had analyzed the business thoroughly.

He did not really know what links he wanted ultimately, but he had some clues. Maester Petyr had taught him a lot about medicin, so he supposed that was a valid choice."

The spirits of the Ainúri knew not these people, their's were evil and barbaric. Stealing and killing, raiding and burning. 

The village that was targeted built a palisade, and other villages that were subject to smaller attacks, and repelled them adopted the same technique, surrounding the core of their village, so that the evil couldn't reach them. 

Soon, it had become a common thing, seen almost everywhere, even in the smallest of villages.

One day in New Barrel…

**Knock Knock**

“Come in!”

The maester entered the room.

“Lord Addam, I think it is time for Aemund to leave for the citadel. There is not much more that I can teach the boy, and the books you bought – Well, he has read them.”

“Hmm, I hear what you say Petyr, but isn’t he still a young boy?”

“He is, but I have friends in Oldtown who can take care of him.”

“Okay then, but he will stay here for another two weeks, I want some more time with him before he leaves.”

“Yes of course”

“Also, don’t forget this”

Addam jingled the purse a little.

---

*Two weeks later*

“Goodbye Aemund, and Good Luck at the Citadel. Make sure you send a letter back to us or come say hello sometime. Keep the horse when you’re in Oldtown she is a good horse, and will serve you well.
“I will Grandfather, goodbye.”

Aemund gave Addam a hug, jumped on the horse and rode away together with the maester.

Oldtown was a beautiful city of stone buildings, winding streets and inns. In the center of the city lay the citadel, and the seat of Hightower.

Aemund would easily have gotten lost in the great city if it had not been for Maester Petyr, he took them safely to the citadel.
The gates of the Citadel were flanked by a pair of towering green sphinxes with the bodies of lions, the wings of eagles and the tails of serpents. One had a man’s face, one had a woman’s. Just beyond stood Scribe’s Hearth, where Oldtowners came to write their wills and read their letters. Nearly a dozen bored scribes stood in their stalls, waiting for some custom. In other stalls books were being bought, and sold.

As they were about to pass by, a merchant stopped them, offering to sell them maps. Maester Petyr refused him, and said to Aemund, “You are going to be staying here for a long time, you had best learn to navigate Oldtown without maps.” He nodded, and they moved on. As they did so, a girl roughly his own age caught Aemund’s eye. She had blonde hair, and blue eyes dressed wealthy as she walked behind a rich merchant. When she noticed him, and met his gaze, Aemund turned his head away as his cheeks turned red.

The path divided at a statue that the maester said was King Dareon’s. There he sat, astride his tall horse, his long sword pointing towards Dorne. “No birds today” Petyr murmured, as the statue passed by on their right side. Soon after, they passed by the Weeping Dock, and continued onwards.

Outside the Seneschals court, three novices were locked in the stocks, some rotten fruit stuck in their hair. 

Beyond the doors was a long hall with stone floor, and high arched windows. At the far end, a man sat upon a raised dais, scratching in a ledger with a quill. Though the man was clad in a Maester’s robe, he wore no chain around his neck. Aemynd walked down the hall, the same hall that Prins Aemon had walked long ago. The man cleared his throat. Before he could speak, Maester Petyr said “Good morning”, he handed over a copper star, “We are here to see the Seneschal.”

“Your names?”

“I am Maester Petyr of the Citadel, and this here” he waved towards Aemund “is Aemund of New Barrel, a Master-to-be”

The fertile land further around the river could grow even better with a fresh and steady supply of nutritious water. Thus, the farmers started to dig small ditches for the water to better supply their farms with water. (**ditch irrigation**)

>Fishing was the main substinence of the Ainúri, and as the villages grew, more elaborate ways of fishing were concieved. The most prominent was the use of **Fishing Weirs**, which allowed a larger amount of fish to be herded through a smaller area, making them easier to catch.

>Among other water based technologies was the use of **buoys**, they made it easier to secure smaller boats further out at sea. Their use was common - in particular combined with fish traps, as they could secure both the traps while the fisher was away, and the boat while he was lifting it out of the water.

>One thing that was very useful in combination with the spear was the **round shield**. This had been prompted by Gedokosza raids. A simple piece of wood could block it, and thus the devastating force that could penetrate human flesh. When shaped in a controllable shape, and adding a handle or strap it was far more useful.

>**Framing** a construction before actually building it made all the difference. Instead of a hodgepodge, one would get a sound structure that more easily stood up to weather and wind. This was all the more important, since the flooding of the river easily could wash away poorly built homes.

The project of contructing the so called ""Port Foss"" would commence within the month. Architects had been occupying the courtyard in New Barrel for a fair while now, and they had finally come up with a pleasing design.

The Fort would consist of a lower wall that encompassed the entire port. This wall would have a single gate as an entry point from the road that came from New Barrel. Inside the main fort would be a smaller burg containing the treasury, garrison and commanders quarters as well as a grain magazine to feed the inhabitants in the event of a siege. The burg itself would be placed along the waters edge, making it even harder to penetrate.

The port itself would be protected by the lower fort wall, and would be built in a similar style to Oldtown, with buildings of stone masonry and paved roads in between. It would be segmented into several areas. The main docks taking care of goods passing through the port, and a smaller one dedicated to warships. There would be two plazas for the exchange of goods, as well as housing for the workers in the harbours, the merchants and inns for potential visitors. Other than that, there would of course be space for any expansions or buildings that haven't been noted here.

From Port Foss will run a road, connecting it to the Ocean Road close to New Barrel, allowing heavier goods and cargo to easily reach it.

The final detail is the Fossoway Estate, located by the sea, away from the docks. It is quite a luxurious affair, designed to be a private retreat for those within the house who would need it.

The sun was slowly sinking into the sea, setting it afire with its fiery glow. She swimmed and laughed, just like she had so many other times. The Stranger whom she knew so well had taught her to swim, to dive. So, she dove. There was something she had seen. After a few moments she breached through the surface of the water, raising her hand in triumph, the sun gleaming from her silvery hair. The Stranger had smiled at her, one of his many faces, this one he only showed to her. It was a beautiful thing, a gift of the sea. The Stranger knew it was very precious, a gift that this Island was known for. But she liked it very much, and the Stranger let her keep it.

Time went by, and she saw him as the Father she never had, lovingly caring for her. Yet it was doomed, for when he stopped being the Stranger, the Stranger came for him.

---

It had gone four years since Aemund forged his latest link - the silver link. He had studied hard the last years, particularly in economics. The Fossoway company in Oldtown hade made a fantastic subject for experimentation and practice, lending Aemund much experience on the subject. 

The day was not entirely unlike the one all those years ago - the day before his exam for the silver link. He woke up early that morning, and headed out from his room in the Citadel dormitory. He grabbed some noms and sat down on a bench, mulling over some of the books he had read and repeating some of the details. There he sat, until somewhat before midday.

After, he headed back to his room and looked at himself in the mirror. He shaved away what little hair was on his cheeks leaving it smooth. He washed his hair thoroughly and brushed it lke he wanted it. Then, he headed over to Dyannas boutique.

It was quite large, and Dyanna was mulling over some bookkeeping. The shop sold all manner of exotic goods from the far East. Aemund sneaked into the back room, where Dyanna sat, and gave her a hug, and nuzzled her neck. ""Hi"" She gave out a small yelp of surprise, but then turned around and gave him a nice kiss.

""What are you doing this evening, got some time?"" Aemund asked her

""No, not really, I got some accounting to do, but I wouldn't mind you joining me"" she gave him a seductive wink.

""Sure, I'll help you - it'll make for good practice for the exam tomorrow""

""Great!

So, the afternoon went by, and the piles of accounting shrunk way down. Of course, it wasn't *all* accounting, but it was so little of the other stuff that they didn't mention it when Dyannes father swung by for dinner. ""You know, I'll be leaving for Qohor tomorrow. ""Yes Father, I know that you're leaving.""

As the night arrived in Oldtown Aemund headed back to the Citadel, for a good nights sleep before the Exam. He slept, he slept, and he slept. Then he woke up. The sun was shining in through the window, and Aemund came to a realization with pure terror *he was going to be late*. Thus, he got his clothes on and rushed out of his dorm and headed for his examination. "

Many had died. Addam poured over the events of the last two years, as his steed carried him ever closer to New Barrel, his home, his family. Unlike many other men he had emerged on the other side of war alive, unscathed, victorious. It had been rough, many had died. Too many. Friends, Ashfords, Family, Footleys, My Sister. He still wept for his sister. He might not have met with her for some time, but she was still close to his heart.

At long last, they arrived in New Barrel, which he had been away from for so long. As he passed through the gates, a faint smile settled on Addams lips. It was good to finally be home. The tension that had been holding his muscles tight now released. Everyone was all right.

She had been watching the long train of horses, wagons and footmen approaching for some time, the Fossoway banners fluttering above. She was relieved. Not because she loved him, but because he made her feel safe, and because he was the father of her children. She would never have forgiven him if he returned as bones in a box.

As Addam hopped down from his horse, she rushed down to meet him. Not because she loved him, because she needed him.

Sheia smiled as she rushed toward him. Gods, how long it had been, her Hazel hair and her green eyes. They fell into each others embrace and their lips met. He warmed inside as Sheia filled up his senses. Her Touch, her Smell, the Sound of her breath. 

Addam had grown harder she thought to herself as her hands caressed his back. He was more muscled, more lean. Those small patches of soft fat that Addam had had were nowhere to be found. But it was not only his body that had grown harder. Some of the light had left his eyes. Death and destruction had darkened his outlook on the world.

As they let go of each other Addam saw his reflection in Sheias eyes. A rift had come between them. He had changed, while she had not. Yet he would try to make her happy all the same.

""How are the children?"" He asked. As Sheia started to reply he saw her eyes shine, the way the eyes of a woman can only do when she speaks of her little treasures, the meaning of her world.

Sheia replied to Addams question, and smiled. ""They are well, my love. The young ones - Aena and Jaeson look forward to meeting their father whom I have told them so much about"". Another kind of happiness came into her husband at that moment. The kind that a loving father feels when he finally knows *why*. And that *why* comes in the form of the children. The loved ones.

---

They were all sitting around the table, having drinks when one of the other novices came with the election result. Aemund smiled as he heard it. The previous seneschal had been reelected. He was younger than the others and more adaptive. Well - as adaptive as a fifty year old man can be.

He himself had quite some experience in the matter - having arrived at the citadel at the young age of 11. Yet Petyr had taken care of him, and he was soon going to try for his first link - the silver link. It was unusual for novices as young as himself to try for links, particularly the medicine link, but he had already been at the citadel four whole years and that had added to his already large knowledge bank.

He took Her by the hand, and they left the pub, having finished their drink. They walked along the road, until they found a bench with a good view of the shore. The sun was slowly sinking towards the endless blue.

Aemund held her soft, beautiful hands in his own. Her deep blue eyes were magical, enveloping him. The first time that they had seen each other was his [very first day in Oldtown](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronThronePowers/comments/5frvlt/event_coming_to_the_citadel/). It had been a whole year until they saw each other again. It was such a fleeting moment, but it was the first time that their eyes met. Deep within himself he had known, but it was not to be until much later.

*It had gone on like that until roughly one year ago. Smiles and greetings. The change had come with spring. The war was over, there was cheering and the weather was getting better - no more rain.*

*It was a Morning - and he was late. He was rushing around a street corner when they bumped into each other. His whole stack of books went flying.*

*""I'm so sorry"" she said, going down to help him pick up the books. Moments later, when she handed him those she picked up, she saw who it was. ""Oh, hello"" she smiled.*

*Aemunds cheeks flushed. ""H-hello"" he said, ""I've always wondered, w-what's your name?"" He managed to stutter. ""Oh, my name is Dyanna"" she had said, in her soft, beautiful voice. ""And you?""*

*A few moments went by, Aemund gathering his guts together ""I'm Aemund"", then he had rushed off again, towards the citadel.*

They rested their heads on each other, as the red sun started to leave the golden horizon. He turned and lifted some of her golden hair away from her ear. ""I love you"" he whispered. The moment could have lasted forever, her face, as she turned. The shine of the sun in her deep blue eyes. The way her mouth was slightly opened, as if she hesitated.

It was almost the same look she had had on her face when he had asked her ""Will you come to the show with me?"" It had come right out of the blue for him. He had been planning to go to the show for quite some time, but it had never occurred to him to bring her. It had just sort of blurted out. But she had said ""Yes"", and so, a week later they were both heading to the fair. 

*It was a play on war, the war of the West. It told of how a gallant knight had fought his way to the heart of a lady. It had been the first time they held hands, entirely by chance. The gallant knight was fighting against the treacherous Craven Daven, one on one. The Knight was winning, but in a deceitful move Daven his the leg of the knight, who fell to his knees. Dyanna had grabbed his hand, and held it tight as all thought that the good Knight would die. Surely he would.*

*Yet, he did not. For as the craven proclaimed his victory - a stray arrow pierced his throat, sending him to the ground as ""blood"" spurted from it. In the end, the wound of the knight healed, and he won the heart of his fair lady. Such was the end.*

*She had caught herself holding his hand at the end ""Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean too..."" Aemund had enjoyed that much more than the actual show. Before she could finish he smiled, and said ""Don't be"" *

She leant in towards him,

*And gave him a hug, ""Thank you for bringing me, Father never let's me see shows like these.*

And kissed him.

He froze for but a moment before returning it. He had not expected her to do so, but a warmth lit up in him, a strange feeling that he could hardly describe. Dyanna pulled back, that perfect smile on her face. ""I have to go"" she said ""My father will miss me, and he can get angry when I'm away too long""

He hadn't known back then...

*Her father was a merchant, and she was an only child. Her mother had died in childbirth and the father had never remarried. But he loved Dyanne above all else, she was his world.*

So, he returned home, happy and smiling, knowing deep down that he always would be happy - as ling as he had her. As he closed his eyes, that day would be forever etched into his memory.

It was Morning...

A part of Nobel's fortune and investments (including his part of the shares in Branobel and Bofors AB) amounting to a value of thirty-three million swedish krona. When the guests had assembled, mr. Nobels will was read aloud yet again.

>*I, the undersigned, Alfred Bernhard Nobel, do hereby, after mature deliberation, declare the following to be my last Will and Testament with respect to such property as may be left by me at the time of my death:*

>*To my nephews, Hjalmar and Ludvig Nobel, the sons of my brother Robert Nobel, I bequeath the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Crowns each;*

>*Mr Georges Fehrenbach, 2, Rue Compiègne, Paris, is entitled to an annual pension of Five Thousand Francs from January 1, 1896 to January 1, 1899, when the said pension shall discontinue;*

>*A sum of Twenty Thousand Crowns each, which has been placed in my custody, is the property of my brother's children, Hjalmar, Ludvig, Ingeborg and Tyra, and shall be repaid to them.*

>*The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way: the capital, invested in safe securities by my executors, shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind. The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics; one part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical work by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm, and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, but that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be a Scandinavian or not.*

>*As Executors of my testamentary dispositions, I hereby appoint Mr Ragnar Sohlman, resident at Bofors, Värmland, and Mr Rudolf Lilljequist, 31 Malmskillnadsgatan, Stockholm, and at Bengtsfors near Uddevalla. To compensate for their pains and attention, I grant to Mr Ragnar Sohlman, who will presumably have to devote most time to this matter, One Hundred Thousand Crowns, and to Mr Rudolf Lilljequist, Fifty Thousand Crowns;*

>*At the present time, my property consists in part of real estate in Paris and San Remo, and in part of securities deposited as follows: with The Union Bank of Scotland Ltd in Glasgow and London, Le Crédit Lyonnais, Comptoir National d'Escompte, and with Alphen Messin & Co. in Paris; with the stockbroker M.V. Peter of Banque Transatlantique, also in Paris; with Direction der Disconto Gesellschaft and Joseph Goldschmidt & Cie, Berlin; with the Russian Central Bank, and with Mr Emanuel Nobel in Petersburg; with Skandinaviska Kredit Aktiebolaget in Gothenburg and Stockholm, and in my strong-box at 59, Avenue Malakoff, Paris; further to this are accounts receivable, patents, patent fees or so-called royalties etc. in connection with which my Executors will find full information in my papers and books.*

>*This Will and Testament is up to now the only one valid, and revokes all my previous testamentary dispositions, should any such exist after my death.*

>*Finally, it is my express wish that following my death my veins shall be opened, and when this has been done and competent Doctors have confirmed clear signs of death, my remains shall be cremated in a so-called crematorium.*

>*Paris, 27 November, 1895*

>*Alfred Bernhard Nobel*

An eery silence fell over the locale as the speaker finished, yet again putting the will away. ""I myself am the [Mr Sohlman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar_Sohlman) mentioned in the will, and have since the death of mr. Nobel been working hard to put those words written and stated by him into reality."", the man paused for a moment. ""I today announce the creation of the Nobel foundation, which will from now and onwards administer the fortune that he left behind to institute this prize.""

He looked at one of the front tables for a moment, and made a little sign for those seated there to step up. He saw the royal family seated at their table further away, slightly elevated with an excellent view over what was happening. He then turned to the men that had just stepped up. He then turned to and shook hands with the first man in the row that had lined up. ""Mr. Henrik Santesson will be the executive director of the foundation, managing the funds left behind by mr. Nobel and growing them to make sure that there will always be a Nobel Prize."" he then continued with the next man, ""Mr. Prime minister, you will be the chairman of the board, always looking to the future of the foundation, and making sure that the prize is awarded to those that deserve them."", then he walked over to the following three men, ""I myself, as well as Mr. Forssell, Mr. Törneblad and Mr. Santesson will be members of the foundations board."" 

""Over the coming days, the institutions mentioned in the will shall elect their Nobel committees. Thank you for your attention, dinner will soon be served, and more will come during the evening."", Mr. Sohlman stepped down from the podium, and took a seat at the table. Hopefully, this foundation would last a long while.

Over the coming few hours, speakers from the different institutions came up and talked a little about their institutions, and what an honor it would be to host the prizes. They came up in the same order as in the will, with the Swedish Academy of Sciences speaking during the starters, followed by the Caroline Institute and the Stockholm Academy during the two main courses. The main courses were finished, and dessert was now served, along with the final speakers for the day, the Norwegians."

She is fairly young, possibly in her late teens, her despairing eyes watching the last of the canoes turn around a bend in the river.


*She had volunteered for the trip, she really didn't have anything to loose. Of course her aunt, who had taken care of her would miss her, her cousins would be sad - but her sisters, her brothers, her parents had all been killed that fateful day, so long ago. She, and her friends had all swum across the river, and could do naught but watch as the evil southerners burned, pillaged and raped.*

Still, she despaired, she was lost from her people, alone far from home. What little gear she had was lost with the canoe. She searched the bank for anything that might have been washed up from the river. She caught a spear floating by, and she had the flint knife strapped at her waist.

She turned into the woods, away from the river, away from everything. She started walking, faster, and faster... She would have to survive on her own. *Me, Aewyn, alone in the wilderness*. She was running. *Home, so far away*. The forest was flying by. *My friends gone*. The forest was now a plain, grass whisking by her legs at tremendous speed. *Home gone*. The yurts were approaching her quickly. *I really should've stuck to the river, shouldn't I?*

The young woman stumbled into the camp, tripped and fell over. Her skin was pale, her long hair chestnut. She was dressed in some kind of skin, still somewhat wet on the outside, fresh water still beading on her skin, on her clothing and in her hair.

Aéwyn rose up, her ankle still hurting and saw the surprised faces of these foreign people. She brushed the dirt of her clothes, and said:

*""Aaye, manke amin?""*"

The baby grinned at its mother

Sheia couldn't help but laugh at that, Nevio was always cute, always funny, and always taking a poop. He seemed to start smelling every half hour or so. 

She loved Nevio with all her heart, but it had become very annoying. He was demanding, and constantly needed someone by his side, day and night. Nevertheless, she had started to return to Addams loving embrace. He loved both her and the child, and they were a happy little family. They had begun riding together through the white apple gardens, she had an apple red mare, elegant and calm. They had also started to train archery together, every morning, she had gotten a lot better with Addams help. There was one other thing that they had done. They had hired an artisan to make a painting of them. In the middle they would both be, but the painting would only be finished once the family was.

She called one of the nannies over, and they changed his diapers.

Addam had been very open with her, showed her a lot of how to manage the holdfast, and she had gotten a hang of it. But the bliss - the bliss of a mother, the love towards a child. It had dominated her feelings the last year. It had always been present, the love towards Nevio, her son.

Thus led to a fierce reputation spreading of the Ainúri. They defended themselves - harshly and with great force. At a gathering of village heads it was decided that small watchcamps would be set up, so any incoming raiders would be detected. With time, the south finally started to expand again, the line of watch moving ever to the southeast."

The world was changing, so much faster than he could keep up. Even so, he would do his best for his people. This was why he started the reform of the Jordanian Educational system, modeled after the British standard.

While education in Jordan has previously only been for the wealthy, primary education (ages 5-11) will not only be free of charge, but those attending will recieve a free meal. The hope with this is to incentivize even poor parents to send their children to school. In addition, lessons will primarily be scheduled in the mornings, so that the children are free to help their parents, or work.

Since neither the boys nor the girls have come of age at during primary education, classes can be hosted for boys and girls together (without angering any religious people).

In conjunction with the extension of primary education throughout the country, the province of the West Bank is also established, its first tasks to rebuild the war-torn area, and arrange temporary lodgings for all the refugees."

As Stortinget went into negotiations, Otto and Gunnar,  Prime minister and leader of the Venstre (liberal) party respectively went to *det Kongelige Slott* (The Kingly Castle) and advised Kong Haakon against appointing Kyrre Grepp, leader of Arbeiderpartiet (The Workers Party) the new prime minister, citing him ""a dangerous revolutionary"". 

According to the norwegian newspaper *Aftenposten*, he replied ""Jeg er också kommunistenes konge."", in english ""I am also the king of Communists."" confidently. Unlike other monarchs of the western world, he had been appointed by his people, only fifteen years ago at an overwhelming eighty percent majority. Soon after, Kyrre Grepp was appointed Prime Minister.

While some worry that this will mean radical change, life goes on in many quiet Norwegian towns, with little care for the larger world.

Even though they recieved slightly above 40% of the popular vote, the *Lagtinget* which in Norway is the upper house of parliament and has slight influence over the seats in lower parliament (Odelstinget), did not give Arbeiderpartiet a single handed majority. While this lessens the power of their government, some argue that it might lead to resentment amongst the voters, and ultimately radicalization."

Jordan had found their nose bloodied in the first months of the war, but others were under far more pressure. The Lebanese government was cracking under the pressure, SSNP infiltrators showing in their midst, Turkey had turned against the Arabs. In Iran and there was word of civil war between socialists and the military. 

After a time of much needed recovery, the Joint Arab forces renewed their offensive. They had to strike while the iron was still hot, and that they would.

During this offensive, the soldiers would be coordinated, use their weapons, unlike in the first phase of the war, where Saudi soldiers had forgotten about their weapons, and Jordanians had marched forwards without support from their artillery, using only their sidearms to fight.

Bloodied, but not beaten, this was their time to shine. For Jordan, For the King, and for all Arabs!

---


While the Syrians were able to repel the initial offensive, Jordanian High Command still has confidence in the superiority.
It has divided the frontline into four different command groups: Purple, blue, green and brown (from west to east). The wounded have been recovering from the previous offensive, and recruits have been going through boot camp, overseen by war veterans unable to return to their previous posts. The Jordanian High Command has been planning a new offensive.

####Purple, Western front:
Their main tasks will be to hold the frontline and make two minor offensives. Around the city of Fiq, they will first capture the southern bank of the river, once this maneuver is completed, securing the flank, a stronger force moves into the town. With only minor artillery support, and airforces focused elsewhere, their advance will have to be slow and methodical using rifles and MG’s from afar, and SMG’s for close-range suppressing fire. Once they are inside the city, enemy artillery will be less able to support their troops and street to street fighting will ensue. The Jordanian forces will not bombard the town to avoid endangering civilians. They will not advance along the Israeli armistice line until the city is captured. Once the operation into the city has begun, an attack will be launched on the road between El-Aal, and with a majority of local enemy forces focused on defending the town of Fiq, the hope is to cut off their supply lines. Once the road is captured, the advance there will stop for the moment, and any Syrian forces in the town will be offered safe retreat to avoid civilian casualties by fighting in the town. We are willing to push against notable resistance here, but if the area is too well defended, the offensive is called off.

At Haita, Purple troops will attempt a push against Sahmej and Tellechaan provided that resistance is not too heavy. Elsewhere along purples frontline, soldiers will hold their positions and entrench if they find suitable ground, otherwise sandbags will be used to provide shelter. In areas with low amounts of troops, continuous lines will not be made, but rather mutually supporting sandbag hardpoints on slightly elevated positions, allowing less troops to cover larger, less important areas, since enemies advancing in these areas matters little (and if an attack is spotted, they can easily call for support via radios).

**Assigned** to Purple command will be JIBrg 1, as well as support from of JIArt 1, JMI 2, JMSPG 1 and JMArm 1. In addition to this JBB 6 will aid. 

**Manpower, Equipment:** En totale, 4500 men (excluding tank & SPG crews), 20 Matilda II tanks, 10 Bishop MkI SPGs, 30 humber armored car, 70 Universal carriers, 1 AEC command vehicle, 2 Humber super snipe (staff vehicle), 300 Jeep (with trailer), 400 Bedford Trucks OY and 200 Bedford OX (w. trailer) for logistics mainly. 40 QF 6-Pounder, 4 17-Pounder, 80 25-Pounder, 10 BL. 4.5, 300 Mortars (2 & 3-inch), 4 Bofors AA guns, 4 Radio Set No. 19, 300 No. 38, 650 Bren LMG, 4500 Grenades, 80 BESA Medium MG, 40 Vickers .50 HMG, 300 Enfield Revolvers, 3000 Combat Knives, 40 Flamethrowers (""Lifebuoy""), 400 Enfield No. 4 Sniper Rifles, 100 PIAT, 4100 Enfield No.4 Rifle (main infantry weapon), 5000+ STEN SMG (close range sidearm).

####Blue, Daraa siege and main offensive:

 The actions around Daraa consist of several steps, the first of these being displayed as red arrows, followed by orange, and lastly, the goal in case of major success are the green arrows. Overall, the goal here is to surround the city, and get it to surrender to Jordanian forces, and once this is finished, continue northwards towards Damascus. We expect resistance to be at its heaviest here, but with superior training to the largely conscripted Syrian soldiers, great support from armor, artillery and good planning, we hope to break through even heavy resistance. Lack of foliage combined with usage of elevated positions and aircraft spotting from within Jordanian airspace will allow accurate artillery fire to be delivered against enemy anti tank- and artillery positions. Similarly, we will use our motorised advantage to at regular intervals relocate our own artillery (tow them) positions across largely flat desert landscapes. AA weaponry and radar equipment will be located at the highest troop concentrations, and tanks supported by mechanized infantry elements are used to overrun enemy entrenchments (which are hard to make quickly in sandy soil) when assaults are conducted after loosening artillery bombardment.. Some of the units south of Deraa on the map will initially be used for *Red** goals, and later relocated for **Orange** goals once the major red objectives are completed. Areas which are not on the offensive will reinforce their positions. **Red** consists of two major actions, and a two secondary goals.  

**Primary**: Capture the road north of Deraa. The road to Deraa is essential to capture, since it supplies the soldiers and civilians of the city. WIthout it, they will crumble. During the recovery period units in this area will be softened by artillery shelling and once the soldiers here are prepared, they will perform a large assault to secure the road, and if possible also the railroad.  The second major goal is to capture the entire southern riverbank close to Deraa, to free up troops for Orange goals as that stretch of the frontline will become significantly easier to defend. The southern bank of the river is also excellent to station supporting artillery in for orange goals.

**Secondary** red goals are to capture the village of Tafass to the north, which establishes a northern foothold, and base of operations for actions northwards along the road, lastly to secure the railroad intersection east of Deraa, allowing it to be used to supply the saudi troops in the Green command area with greater effectiveness.

The **Orange** goals are twain, and will not commence unless the major Red goals have been accomplished. The first goal is to advance around the city, surrounding it and capturing all land up to the Ouádi river, securing the Jordanian hold around the city, and the possibility to use the railroad heading north from Deraa. After this has been accomplished, all Deraa will be allowed conditional surrender. Thus far the city has been spared from shelling and combat, and it is Jordans intention to spare Syrian civilians from the horrors of war. Therefore, all Syrian soldiers in Dera will be offered amnesty and free passage northwards if they lay down their arms. A period of 24 hours of deliberation will be allowed, during which civilians will be allowed to leave if they wish, and food will still be allowed to pass into the city. If the Syrians accept, the agreement is honored and green arrows commence. If not, a siege of the city will begin, with all supplies being cut off and the city being shelled. Not much all the time, but always a little. After a week, the city will be offered an unconditional surrender, and if that is refused, close quarters combat will ensue with attacks from all sides.

**Green** Major Goal. Reaching the green goals is a sign that the Blue Plan has had major success so far, and now is the time to capitalize on this. Armored elements will strike swiftly northwards along the Deraa road with mobile artillery support, breaking through Syrian defenses with motorized infantry securing the road behind it. They will advance until they encounter major resistance. If they pass Cheikh, **secondary** elements will be sent east and west along the road to Qnaitra and Soueida until they too encounter resistance.

**Assigned** in the Blue command will be the rest of JM (JMI 2, JMArt, JMArM 2-8, JMSPG 2-3) division as well as JIArt 2 and JBB 5, but will if necessary also call upon JMI 1 from Purple command for support.

**Manpower, Equipment**: En totale, 4750 men (excluding tank & SPG crews), 5 Centurion Tanks, 135 Matilda II tanks, 11 M24 Chaffee, 20 Bishop MkI SPGs, 35 humber armored car, 150 Universal carriers, 2 AEC command vehicle, 4 Humber super snipe (staff vehicle), 450 Jeep (with trailer), 450 Bedford Trucks OY and 700 Bedford OX (w. trailer) for logistics mainly. 55 QF 6-Pounder, 6 17-Pounder, 90 25-Pounder, 20 BL. 4.5, 100 Mortars (2 & 3-inch), 5 Bofors AA guns, 4 Radio Set No. 19, 300 No. 38, 750 Bren LMG, 4750 Grenades, 100 BESA Medium MG, 50 Vickers .50 HMG, 500 Enfield Revolvers, 1500 Combat Knives, 60 Flamethrowers (""Lifebuoy""), 800 Enfield No. 4 Sniper Rifles, 70 PIAT, 4500 Enfield No.4 Rifle (main infantry weapon), 5000+ STEN SMG (close range sidearm).


####Green, Bosra and Imtane minor offensives: 

Will cut off the supply road between Deraa and Bosra ech Cham and secure the village of Imtane, the river beyond it for a defensive position, as well as the southern bank of the river close to Houte and the road up to the town Salkhad. This command group is covered by the Saudi units. 

While the overall goals have been set and coordinated by Jordanian Joint Command, the details of these actions are arranged by the Saudi commanders. {In a Saudi conflict post}

####Brown, Deep Desert Operations 

(orders and positions for this command continue in the second map): The units in this area have general orders, but will mainly operate independently. It is a long stretched area of desert of little value strategically, but losing or gaining land here still has an overall political value, and supports both the Iraqi and Syrian main fronts. Soldiers here will be deployed at strategic defensive points (bridges, hills looking over large swathes of desert), and also aim to capture such points from the enemy.

JBB 1-5 are deployed here

**Manpower, Equipment**: En totale, 2000 men, 6 humber armored car, 30 Universal carriers, 1 AEC command vehicle, 4 Humber super snipe (staff vehicle), 50 Jeep (with trailer), 100 Bedford Trucks OY for logistics mainly. 150 Mortars (2 & 3-inch), 2 Radio Set No. 19, 300 No. 38, 190 Bren LMG, 750 Grenades, 20 BESA Medium MG, 10 Vickers .50 HMG, 500 Enfield Revolvers, 500 Combat Knives, 600 Enfield No. 4 Sniper Rifles, 30 PIAT, 1400 Enfield No.4 Rifle (main infantry weapon), 2000+ STEN SMG (close range sidearm).

####The Airforce

Will attempt to keep superiority if possible, but not work aggressively in Shrian space except for night raids. They strike at the infrastructure marked by pink spots to sabotage Syrian supplies during night raids. They are supported inside Jordan by two high-precision radars with a range of 30 km each. One deployed in Irbid and one in Amman. Given the surprise appearance of skilled MIG fighters, all actions will be escorted by jet and prop fighters, with radar warning against any intrusions into Jordanian airspace, allowing jet fighters to rise to the challenge under AA support. While older prop fighters are greatly inferior to Jets at higher altitudes, they have superior agility and are maneuverable far below jet fighter stall speeds. This, combined with numerical superiority and pilot skill (The Jordanian Airforce has been using Spitfires for several years, practicing alongside british jet fighters), can allow them to wage a sort of low-altitude guerilla warfare against Syrian jets.

They are **deployed** across five airfields. 59 Spitfires, 10 Mosquitos, 11 Vampires and 30 Bristol Beaufighters.

A majority of **supplies**  for the army pass through the port of Aqaba and arrive in northern Jordan by rail. (Though there are plenty of roads as alternatives) From there, the major supply lines are marked in green. Trucks used to supply each command group are included in their equipment ledger.

**Division Key**: The letters represent nation, division and company/Brigade. J(ordan)B(anü)B(rigade)  (Bedouin Brigades), JMArM/L (armored company), JMSPG (SPG battery), JMArt (Motorized Artillery), JMI (Motorized Infantry), JIBrg (Infantry Brigade), JIArt (Infantry Artillery).

**Map Key** (apply for both maps): Each command area is shown by the colored border. The yellow line is the current frontline. Green lines in Jordan represent major supply lines (these follow roads and rails). Troop positions are designated in Cyan (dots are the lowest numbers, while lines are continuous, with several parallel lines representing large concentrations, more lines = more troops). Arrows and stopped arrows (arrow to a line) represent offensive actions, and combat goals.

In the Northeastern deserts of Jordan, elements of the Banü Camel Brigade would be cooperating with Omani infantry in desert warfare and infrastructure strikes with the Omani operating closer to Amman.

Along the green line and the rest of Jordans western border, JIBrg 2 and elements from the Banü Brigade would attempt to delay a fictitious invasion from the West long enough for reinforcements to arrive.

Lastly, the main training area would be in northern Amman all the way up to the Syrian border. Mechanized elements would be fighting along the Amman highway, and infantry would be hard pressed in the Capital as army HQ was forced to retreat northwards under enemy air superiority (simulated by the Leagues own aircraft, who in turn would be practicing ground support). This would culminate in a battle around Irbid.

In an effort to both appease the Bedouin by funneling funds to them, but also getting vital competence for desert warfare into his army, King Abdullah decided to found the Banü Camel Brigade. A battalion of Bedouins, funded and armed by the Jordanian state and trained by british officers in the Arab Legion. Its members would mainly be from the Banü tribe, hence the name.

In a way, she didn't have the courtesy of a noble lady, and neither did she dress the part, but she did have much of the education of a noble, much thanks to Maester Rolley and the library of Horn Hill.

In the camp of the Osgreys however, she had been stifled. Stuffed away in the darkness of the tent, only seeing the light the few times she was allowed out. There weren't even any books to read, or whichever there were she had read several times over.

So, she started keeping the servants longer each time they came to service her, just speaking with them, until they started getting in trouble for taking too long. She was, quite literally, bored."

###The Dawn of the World

*When everything began, there was the world, empty and devoid. For eons it was this way, empty and cold.*

*Then Eykka came to be, there was light, warm and comforting. For eons it was this way, warm and bright.*

*Then Eykka was lonely, for there was only it, bright and lonely. For eons it contemplated.*

*Then Eykka created the others.*

*It created Maapa, solid and hard, it would create and carry the weight of creation.*

*It created Mer, fluid and soft, it would be the blood of creation, the cradle of life itself.*

*It created Ilm, to carry its words to the others, and to fill the world - Mailm with sound.*

*For Eons they lived in harmony, creating others in their images.*

###The Great Betrayal and Punishment

*But, then came the great betrayal. One of Maapas creations had long been awed by the greatness and brightness of Eykka.*

*The awe turned to jealousy, and when Eykka finally went to sleep, it asked Maapa to reach towards the heavens, and allow them to see Eykka for itself.*

*So it did, and the child climbed to the highest peak, and leapt into the heavens. Soon it had stolen some of Eykka's light for itself.*

*But, Eykka awoke, and the child, fearing punishment killed Eykka and fled into the sky.*

*Soon, Eykka awoke, and in its weakened state it inflicted the worst punishment upon creation, splitting everything to two, Uros, and Nainen.*

*The Uros would be forced to toil and labor, sweat, fight and die, this harshest of punishments was inflicted upon Maapa, henceforth known Maaperä and his children for killing Eykka.*

*The Nainen were weakened, and would be forced to endure the same pain that Eykka had every month, and tenfold when making their own creations. This for not aiding Eykka when the traitorous child killed it. So, Mer became Meri and Ilm became Ilma.*

*However, this punishment took its toll on the injured Eykka, and it fell down from the heavens, and upon Maaperä, splintering to two pieces. Aurinka was the larger of them, and would shine brighter than all else, and Kayo was the lesser, that would light the night sky together with Maaperä's child Kuu.*

One of the girls in the hut looked at the shaman curiously, ""So we are the Nainen, and the..."" she paused for a moment and made a grimace, ""...*others* are the Uros?""

The priestess gave a little smile to the girl, ""Yes, and that is why they are not allowed in here.""

###The Kaksikansa, The two Peoples

The Kaksikansa is a very split people, with women running most of society from behind the guise of religion. Men, the Uro, are considered inferior, and are kicked out from the female-run societies once they approach puberty - or start showing interest - something strictly forbidden.

These then are received into the smaller villages and hunting bands, which are mainly male. Here they have to toil greatly to survive, and pass a test for manhood once they reach age of maturity - or be doomed to be a kuohilas, punished and sent back from whence they came to be slaves.

Meanwhile the girls are taught in the ways of women, religion and female arts. The girls must also pass their test for womanhood, which in essense is passing through the rituals of religion, and giving birth to their first daughter. The so-called hieno occurs at a later age for women than the ihminen for their male counterparts. 

There are occasionally so-called vaihto where men come to trade their hard earned goods for other goods produced in the Nainen societies, and occasionally for pleasure, which comes at a premium.

The minor, mainly male villages often hunt in the surrounding forests, chop wood for building materials and run small scale agriculture as well.

The larger, mainly female villages use agriculture to sustain themselves, make cloth in their looms to trade away, as well as growing herbs and harvesting honey from wild bees.

Most of the houses that the Kaksikansa people live in are built from the logs in the forests around them.

Winter is often the time of rituals and celebrations, where Eykka and Aurinka are celebrated, as well as the other gods and godesses that keep the world going.

Every full moon the priestesses of the villages (that often also together make the main decisions) hold rituals to the honor of the corresponding gods. Midsummer is also a very important celebration, where the most prominent of the men are let into the female-run societies, and allowed to stay for one full moon. 

Last, but not least - the Kaksikansa can be quite friendly towards foreigners, one thing that however permeates this part of their culture as well is the split between male and female. Men are treated with thorough disdain by Kaksikansa women, and foreign women by much desire from the men - sometimes to dangerous levels.

At the end of life, most are cremated or buried, since there is no belief in an afterlife, the rituals surrounding death are more in celebration of what the individual achieved, than in mourning of the death. Especially since there is little to no familial structure.

New soldiers are being recruited, equipment is being produced, and ships commisioned.

During the summer, a rough twenty thousand men took part in the summer army drills. In addition to this, the construction of the Boden Line against Russia continues.

On the side of the navy, seven ships were brought into service, six of those being armed and armored. The ships are:

* HMS Orkan, HMS Bris and HMS Vind all being [1st class torpedo boats](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/1:a_klass_torpedb%C3%A5t).

* [HMS Claes Uggla](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Claes_Uggla) & [HMS Psilander](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Psilander_(1899\)), [Torpedo Cruisers](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedkryssare)

* [HMS Dristigheten](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Dristigheten_(1900\)), a [coastal defense ship](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansarskepp) of the [Odin class](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oden-klass)

* Last but not least, [HMS Jarrams](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Jarramas_(1900\)), a schooling vessel for cadets to train at sea.

####Arms Industry

Aside from orders made by the swedish army for more rifles and field cannons, the combined swedish arms industry has gotten a few orders that are produced.

* 60 pieces of 30.5 cm caliber bofors ship artillery (at 10'000£ unit) along with 6000 matching matching all-in-one shells (at 80£/unit); 70 front loaded 85mm bofors cannons (700£/unit) along with 8500 cannonballs (7£/unit) along with appropriate gunpowder in the shape of ballistite; 20 rear loaded 68mm bofors field cannons (1'200£/unit) with 2000 all-in-one shells (14£/unit). These are then delivered to Italy at a total price of 1,240,500£. Bofors takes the entire order, and produces and delivers the weapons as fast as possible. 

* An order from the OVS for weapons and mining equpment. 2'500 satchels will be produced by Bofors Nobelkrut AB and fetch a price of 12'500£. 7'500 m/1896 rifles will be produced in joint by Carl Gustafs Vapenfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabrik AB. These will fetch a price of 88'500£. The ammunition will be produced from the same manufactories, and come in metal cases with 50 bullets each. 15'000 cases of ammunition will fetch a price of 9'000£. This amounts to a compound price of 110'000£. Any transport costs will be calculated from Gothenburg harbor if they will need be transported any additional distance.

In a way, she had always been a little revered by her 'siblings', her noble origins an exciting mystery.  But, as time had passed, the washermaid that had taken her on had slowly started treating her worse, as hope of the Castle ever being relieved from occupation had dwindled. Over time, she had drawn herself away from the others, not quite feeling she fit in. The Maesters library had become where she lived when she could escape her duties. She had occasionally gotten reprimanded, but the occupiers had never treated her badly. Only the one time, when she had spilled a tray of soup over the commander had she been locked away for a night in the dungeon. A mistake she never repeated. During the year however, she had started to feel changes in her body, one day, she caught one of the older guards staring at her. Truly horrifying.

They had all been surprised when word of the Tarly banner being spotted started to filter down among the servantfolk, but deep down, Cecilia had felt a tingle of joy, maybe, maybe she would see her brother again.

---

The heat was truly stifling, and Cecilia was on her knees, tears running down her cheeks  What would she do now? All that she had ever known was gone, the flakes of ash rising towards the sky, people rushing to and fro with buckets of water. The charred stones of her home rose upwards, and she remembered the dead stare of Anthon, her 'sibling' when she had ran out from the kitchens.

First, the men with black shields had come, and they payed her little mind, soon after however, green clad men had rushed in, voices in a panic. A commanding voice had boomed out, and soon after they were hauling water to put out the fires. She recognized the emblem, and felt for the pendant tied to her wristband, hidden beneath her clothes. A bronze huntsman, laced with silver. As she looked at it for a moment, tears till rolling down from her eyes, a man stepped down from his horse, and picked her up. ""Is it really you, Cecilia?"", Ser Edric had asked.

Through rain and snow the carriage went. Through mud and slush until they reached the paved Kingsroad. Inns they passed along the road, some they slept in.

Cecilia could hardly believe that she had finally been released. A planned escape that was never executed, instead the cage opened by her captors.

Her life had been changed by this time, likely forever. Never had she been taught the proper mannerisms of ladies, never had she danced or pranced upon the courts of kings and nobles.  Neither they had known her, nor she them and such, she thought, it would likely remain.

What she had learned though was the art of picturing the world,  conveying meaning through letter and paint. As they went over yet another bump, she clutched her notebook in her lap, a smile slowly forming on Cecilia's lips."

One main point that had been touted was the ""Right of Return"", so finely crafted into the armistice agreement, and now to be finalized in a treaty. Yet, their ambitions were not to be fullfilled, and Glubb Pasha returned from East Jerusalem in shame.

The fallout was inevitable. The King, who had previously been resisting notable Imams demands for him to restrict East Jerusalem to the Israelis and denounce them to the Jordanian people now accepted these anti-Israel sentiments in an effort to save face. Indeed, a majority of those who had argued for peace now fell silent, as their wishes for negotiations had been answered, and their hopes dashed.

The first of many changes to come was that all Israelis would be prohibited from entering Jordan, and especially east Jerusalem. This was, of course in violation of article VIII of the Jordan-Israeli armistice, but this was voided by the Israelis refusal to allow civilian refugees access to return to their homes and properties.

In addition to this, nigh all of the back-channels between the nations fell silent, and the Fedayeen who had previously been largely suppressed by the Jordanians were now often ignored by local commanders, some rumors even circulating that they were actively being aided.

Some were already finding themselves in possession of two homes, with occupied territories in Palestine now liberated by Arab troops. 

The Arab Brotherhood League party started printing big posters and putting up all over the country. They featured Arabs side by side ousting the European invaders once and for all.

At the side of the metal gate was a large sign in carved wood:

>Admissions, food and services

>5 Dragons per person 

>12 Dragons for a group

And on either side of it stood a guard in ceremonial armor, the banners of Lady Cecilia flowing from the gateposts long and green, upon it the paintress that represented her.

Behind those guards, the Manse was more alive than it had ever been within memory. The metal gate was open and inviting, large enough for a carriage to pass through.

 “In the name of the Father I charge you to be just.”, his mentor continued.

 Back to the right, the sword no longer felt as cold, but he started to realize his knees were still sore from the vigil.

 “In the name of the Mother I charge you to defend the young and innocent.” 

The left. *Where was his mother*, he asked himself, as the blade switched positions yet again.

“In the name of the Maid I charge you to protect all women.”

The sword changed shoulder yet again.

""In the name of the Smith I charge you to be strong, for those who are not.""

The sword returned to Damons left shoulder, soon he would rise again, reborn with new purpose.

""In the name of the Crone I charge you to be wise and not ti decieve.""

For the last time, the sword settled, and the final sentence was uttered, one that was seldom spoken, yet he remembered all the same.

""In the name of the Stranger, I charge you to uphold these vows even in the face of death, and utter ruin.""

The old knight stopped speaking, and for a mere moment, there was silence, then, Damon could hear his own voice replying, confirming the vows and charges that had been laid upon him. It passed in a blur, hardly a moment had passed, when he heard the gravelly voice of an old man once more.

""Rise, *Ser* Damon Tarly, Knight in the eyes of the Seven.""

He could feel the pride rise through him as he stood up, *The Tarly Knight*, the only of his name.

A small round of applause came from the meagre gathering, and a few cheers. Damon smiled to himself, '*So, the end of my beginning*', he thought."

The Kingdom of Norway, the nation with the worlds longest coast, one of the youngest European nations on the map before the treaty of Versailles, having only seceeded from a personal union with King of Sweden, Oscar the II in 1905, even though the nation itself was founded in 1814 after the treaty of Kiel. While the secession could have turned bloody, peace was maintained, and Haakon VII became the new King, a Norwegian King for a Norwegian people.

During the Great War, Norway was largely neutral, but the central powers, specifically Germany sunk almost half the Norwegian trade fleet, which caused growing anti-german sentiment through the war.

As for the economy, Norway, which was in 1905 a backwater fishing country, quickly industrialized through the help of extensive use of hydropower. Major companies such as Norsk Hydro, Orkla, Aker Kværner and DNB quickly achieved prominence with the swedish yoke cast away.

###Recent History

During the most recent election, in a big upset, the Labour Party achieved single-handed majority. This was a big upset, and there have been worryings in the upper echelons of Norwegian society, that the Bolshevik flame might be reaching Norway. Who knows what is to come?

Meanwhile, the Brotherhood Badge would start seeing distribution in Jordan, a symbol of Arab unity and patriotism. Soldiers and civilians aiding the war effort in any way would recieve it with the words, ""White are our deeds, Black are our battles,
Green are our fieldsand Red are our swords.""

It took its shape in a lapel pin decorated with the [flag of the Arab revolt](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Flag_of_Hejaz_1917.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Hejaz_1917.svg.png).

Only three years ago war broke out in the principality as the Kashmiri government failed. The result was a stalemate between the two neighbors with a ceasefire line going straight through the mountainous province. Three years they have all had to build trenches and fortifications, procure arms and incite the locals, while the UN has tried, and failed to broker an end to the conflict. That failure became the spark that has finally set the province ablaze once more. In the smoldering heat of August the thrum of hundreds of propeller planes could be heard and not long after the thundering of artillery began. 

With IAF jets soaring in Indian airspace and propeller engine aircraft setting targets for artillery and bombers, it was not long before Pakistani Sabres rose to meet the IAF. They were ready for this attack. PAF fighters found themselves swamped, targets everywhere they turned, shooting down one WW2 aircraft after another. The small number of PAF mustangs however were swiftly decimated.

The Pakistani were determined to hold their positions, supported by jet fighters from above. Aware of the superiority of the Sabre to Indian Vampires and Meteors, the Indian airforce kept their jets outside of Pakistani airspace, hoping to bait Sabres into unfavorable positions. The PAF however had no interest in contesting air superiority over India. Instead, they focused  on fighting off the IAFs overwhelming numbers of low-altitude propeller planes for spotting and ground support. When Sabres had descended upon their older aircraft, IAF jets engaged, seeing initial success where several Sabres were downed. Soon however, the PAF realized that their superiority was in speed and altitude and adopted zoom and boom tactics, limiting PAF casualties while remaining effective against IAFs ww2 aircraft. Overall, the IAF succeeded in their goal of providing ground support, but at a heavy cost incurred both equipment and morale.

On the ground, the story was similar. The IAF had succeeded in providing ground support, despite the unfavorable terrain and contested airspace. However, even with this, progress for the Indian army was slow, and the Pakistanis were making them pay dearly for the ground gained. In the inhospitable mountain terrain and smoldering heat, both sides dealt with equipment breakdowns. Particularly problematic for the Indians was the fact that to extend supply lines into territory taken, the remains of combat had to be cleared away from the roads.

As the conflict came to a head, many militias slipped into the Indian side of Kashmir during the nights, attempting to sabotage supply lines and rile up anti-hindu sentiment amongst the people of Kashmir. While public opinion in Kashmir was decidedly pro-Pakistan, Hindu forces stationed as security along vital supply lines were able to prevent any major damage.

####The Organized Withdrawal from Syria and the rise of anti-British sentiment in Jordan

With the signing of a peace with the SNP, a slow and organized withdrawal from Syria by Jordanian and Saudi forces were organized. The previously occupied territories, notably the city of Deraa had been left largely unscathed.

There was one major issue however. While the war was not a military defeat, its success was so limited that it became a PR-disaster for King Abdullah. There was however a clear scapegoat - the United Kingdom and their NATO allies. It was only with their guarantee for support that the Arab League had acted against SNP Syria. Not only did the british fail to support the Arab Legion, they also imposed an arms embargo and broke several treaties, threatening war upon Jordan. King Abdullah had seen his staunchest ally stab him in the back.

The Jordanian public had been outraged by the peace. Many saw it as pointless, but with the foundation of the Jordanian Radio Service by the end of the war, much of that rage was redirected towards the British. King Abdullah made rousing speeches of how Arabs would stand tall and protect their nation in the face of western betrayal. This was used to further strengthen the Arab Legion and meanwhile RAF airplanes in Jordan found themselves stranded, their basing rights revoked.

####The Election of '52 and a revised constitution

As Jordan was heading out of the disaster that was the Arab-SNP war, anti-British sentiment was regularly heard in Jordanian radio. While party organizations were prohibited at the time, informal alliances could be found amongst them. Notably members that would later found the Jordanian Communist Party, the Ba'ath Party, the Arab Constitutional Party, the Umma Party and the Arab Brotherhood League. The Arab Brotherhood league had come from a large section of Jordanians that had been awarded the Brotherhood Badge for their service in the war.

A third stage to the constitution was added. It reinforced the rights of the hereditary monarchy, but also brought new political developments in light of recent events. Most prominently the Arab-Israeli war and the annexation of the West Bank. As a result of these political conditions, a need was made to amend the constitution in 1947, and the amended constitution came in nine chapters, focusing on the principle of separation Between the three authorities of the state, stating the rights and duties of Jordanians, and describing the state, its system of government, and others. Most notably the foundation of the bicameral Jordanian Parliament. This is divided into a 65 seat senate appointed by the monarch in accordance with the new constitution and a house of representatives with 130 seats which is elected by the public. This was accompanied by the legalization of political parties.

Overall, the new constitution put the parliament in an advisory role to the Monarch, but it was a great step forward in Jordanian public representation.

####The Arab Legion

During most recent war, it became painfully obvious that the Arab Legion and Jordanian airforce was incredibly incompetent, failing against a Syrian army with inferior training, numbers and equipment for a long enough period that they could import soviet equipment and train almost double the Jordanian army in manpower. So, during these years a new core staff was created from the remnants of the british officers in the legion, and a military college was founded in Amman. Jordan would prepare for future conflicts with a Land-Air war doctrine, using the experience they had gotten from conflicts with both Israel and Syria, both being some of the most recent conflicts in history, utilizing modern equipment as well as large amounts of mechanized equipment and aircraft.

The Arab Legion represented the core of the power of the Jordanian Monarchy, its members originally being mainly Bedouin, but all indoctrinated with loyalty in mind and receiving significant benefits. With the end of the war, those Palestinians who joined the army would also find themselves receiving homes and funds in the West Bank, leading to many of them starting businesses once they retired spreading the monarchist sentiment there too.

####West Bank Development and the Arabization of Al'Quds

Five years had now gone since the end of the Arab-Israeli war and the recovery of the West Bank was beginning to show. Large amounts of funds had been funneled into reconstruction by the Jordanian Government, UNRWA and the Arab League as a whole. Some nationalist sentiments had blossomed in the area, but they had been largely directed towards the infidels to the west (Israel). 

In other news, many mosques in Al'Quds (Jerusalem) were being rebuilt and the Arab community there was flourishing. Synagogues and other jewish monuments such as the temple wall are slowly falling into disrepair, and without protection, many have seen vandalism. Christians have been allowed to continue their pilgrimages relatively undisturbed however."

With almost half of its population of nine hundred thousand being former Palestinians now under Jordanian rule. Many of them are refugees, all of them are stateless. It will be one of the first questions that King Abdullah has to tackle, along with a precarious foreign relation with the newly founded ""State"" of Israel.

*Economy*

Unlike almost all of its neighbors, Jordan has not been blessed with black gold, and thus almost half of its economy is based on agriculture. That economy is still tied to the British Pound, something the government will be eager to change.

GDP is estimated at 200 million USD

*Military*

This is one of the few sections where the Jordanians shine. The Arab Legion has been trained and armed by the british, and many of its officers still are, much to the chagrin of London, when they participated in the war against Israel. Twelve thousand men divided into an infantry division, an artillery brigade, a mortar battery, an artillery battery and a field aid unit. It's airforce is meager, fielding only a few de havilland vampires, and a Vickers VC. 1 Viking serving as the Kings VIP aircraft.

As for the navy, there are only a few patrol boats under the command of the army in Aqaba.

The  World War had left large amounts of relatively modern equipment available to be purchased for rather low prices. So, several expansions were decided upon for the Jordanian military.

During the year, several significant purchases of military material were made from both the British and the Americans.

Thus, the Arab Legion recieved motorised equipment for supply logistics, as well as the foundation of a mechanized branch. This mechanized branch consisted of armored units, motorised infantry units as well as artillery units.

The Jordanian Royal Airforce recieved its own independent commander, as well as several new fighters and bombers to operate from those airfields that had been largely unused since the RAF left them.

Lastly came the formation of the Royal Jordanian Navy. While not really a Navy in size or force and rather a coast guard, its newly purchased patrol vessels would greatly help to enforce Jordanian territorial waters around Aqaba.

With all this in mind, all three branches began recruitment, training and expansions, for the best way to secure their sovereignty would be with a modern army. Not all that surprising however, was that a significant number of those who volunteered for the Jordanian military were Palestinians. A service within it would give good pay, housing and food for those that had lost everything in the war."

Goodnight to y'all!~~

##House Tarly of Horn Hill

House Tarlys is a minor house with a great history, a house of marcher Lord's that have been the great bastion against foreign Invaders from the south (ehem Dorne). Even though the house has been through some hardships in recent years, Lady Ellyn has finally reached maturity, and is ready to take the mantle of her forebearers. Which direction the house will head is unclear, but it most definitely will be an interesting read.

###The Family

* **Lady Ellyn**, 23 years old, is the current head of the family is a fair young Lady in her finest years. She has a lot ahead of her, and a lot is at stake for her and her house. While she was quite insecure in her teens, she has had a bit of time to grow into the confidence and maturity of the Lordship. Her marriage to Roger Tyrell is one that brings with it the support and connections of the Paramount house, some within the family have however not forgotten what befell the late Lord Samwyle, and his father before him. 

* Miss **Alayne Tarly**, 20 years old, is the younger sister of the Lady. She was very much a forgotten younger sibling, having lived nearly her entire life in the general vicinity of Horn Hill. Unlike her elder sister whom was destined for Ladyhood and wardened with the Ashford, she was raised at home. It was her widowed mother Bethany who was supposed to take responsibility for her upbringing, but she was never quite the same since the beheading of her late husband. Thus is had fallen to her Great-Uncle Hectyr to take care of her. He did his best, bless him, with the help of Alayne's aunt-in-law Eleanor, who might not have had the best of influences on the young girl.

*  Lady **Bethany Tarly neé Ball**, 47 years old, is the widow of the late Lord Samwyle. She never quite recovered after his beheading, and has been somewhat distant ever since, sometimes bursting into action, sometimes crumbling under the weight of her emotions. Needless to say, it rendered her role in Alayne's upbringing, and the ruling of the house minimal. She firmly dislikes the husband of her daughter, as his presence brings back uncomfortable memories of past events.


* Great-Uncle **Hectyr Tarly**, 63 years old, was for a long time the de-facto regent of the house, and even though his brothers granddaughter now officially has taken her seat as Lady, he holds a quite measurable amount of influence, especially with the vassals of the house. Despite his age, he is still has an air of seriousness about him, something he carried home from his days in Essos. He is well aware that his time on this Earth is running out, but that will not stop him from passing on his mission for vengeance.

* Uncle **Clifford Tarly**, 42 years old, was the Lord Regent of Horn Hill for a long time, but never had any real power in the house.

It was a heinous act of horrible massacre, yet only that. Not even the Stockholm Bloodbath over five hundred years ago, had been as bloody as this. Almost three and a half hours had gone before the all-clear signal - a ninety second long steady tone - was sounded across the country, yet even so, the army remained on high alert.

&nbsp;

One hundred and thirty-seven members of parliament had been brutally murdered, along with many more in the service staff as well as many wounded. Among the wounded was the Gösta Bagge - the Prime Minister and the grandson of the King, Prince Gustaf Adolf. 

The Prince had drawn his service weapon, being the only member of parliament permitted to carry one as a member of the Royal Household, Minister of Defence and Major within the Army. He personally had shot dead three of the attackers, taking a bullet to his shoulder in the process. For his bravery, he would be rewarded the [Royal Order of the Seraphim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Order_of_the_Seraphim) by the King himself in the hospital, and would reach become a national hero in the eyes of the people.

&nbsp;


The day had not yet come to an end when the gunmen had been tied to the Pan-Aryan league by the Third Branch of the State Police - something that would spark a massive outrage not only from the public, but also the Royal Family. The connection between them and the Pan-German League, an organization sponsored by the German State had been established long ago, and was no secret.

With a majority of the Riksdag out of action as well as the Prime Minister being wounded, and vice killed, the King and the Supreme Commander had taken it upon themselves to restore order. The representatives who had escaped the massacre unscathed - either through sheer luck, or having been somewhere else were all assembled in the courtyard of the royal castle. 

Three motions were proposed and passed, right in that courtyard by unanimous assent from the assembled representatives, even those from the Social Democratic Party.

* An amendment to the constitution allowing the implementation of temporary martial law with assent from at least two of the following legal instances (the King, the Supreme Commander, the Prime Minister and the Riksdag) that would need to be confirmed by the other two instances within two weeks, and mandated to be revisited once per month by the Riksdag.

* The reformation of the Third Branch of the State Police into the Swedish Security Service (Rikspolisstyrelsens säkerhetsavdelning RPS/Säk) as a separate branch of government from both the military and police with their own budget.

* The labelling of the NAL and PGL as terrorist organizations (a new term within swedish law which also received a definition) permitting the arrest and conviction of any member based on the crimes of other members.

&nbsp;

As the evening was drawing near, the King himself made a speech to the Swedish People over radio, only the second time that this happened in Swedish History.

[(In Swedish)](https://youtu.be/K_V8g41bLgo)

""Kära Svenskar, jag har just avslutat ett möte med Rikspolischefen och Överbefälhavaren om förmiddagens attack. Först och främst vill jag säga att mina och kungafamiljens tankar går till offren för detta avskyvärda dåd. Det är våra medmänniskor, våra representanter som dödats och bragts om livet.""

""Vi tänker också på deras familjer och vänner, vi känner också med de i deras sorg och oro. Vi är alla omskakade om det som har hänt. Det är samtidigt hoppfullt att se den omtanke som människor visar varandra och det visar på den här kraften i vårat samhälle. Alla vi som vill hjälpa är många många fler än de som vill oss ont. Den vetskapen ger mig tröst och tillförsikt.""

""Armé, polis, sjukvård och räddningstjänst har gjort ett fantastiskt arbete för att minimera skadeverkningarna. Nu är det viktigt att de får arbeta vidare i lugn, och ro. Sverige är och har länge varit, och skall fortsätta vara ett tryggt och fredligt land.""

""Det är även av denna anledning som jag har gett regeringen i uppdrag att utkräva upprättelse från den Tyska staten och deras kumpaner för denna hemska gärning mot det Svenska folket. Denna dag kommer alltid att kännas i våra hjärtan och det minsta vi kan göra är att ge de som omkommit rättvisa.""

&nbsp;

(In English)

""My fellow Swedes, I have just concluded a meeting with the National Police Chief and the Commander-in-Chief about this morning's attack. First of all, I want to say that my and the royal family's thoughts go to the victims of this heinous act. Those killed are not only our fellow people, but also our representatives.""

""We also think of their families and friends, we feel for them in their grief and worry. We are all shaken by what has happened. At the same time, it is hopeful to see the care that our people show for each other and it shows this immense force in our society. Those of us who want to help are many, many more than those who want to hurt us. That knowledge gives me comfort and confidence. ""

""The army, police, medical and rescue services have done their very best to minimize the harm. Now it is imperative that they be able to continue their work in peace and quiet. Sweden is, has been and will continue to be a safe and peaceful country.""

""It is also for this reason that I havetasked the government with demanding redress from the German state and their accomplices for this horrible deed against the Swedish people. This day will be felt forever in our hearts and the least we can do is give those who have perished justice. ""


&nbsp;

With domestic affairs being taken care of, the eyes of the Swedish People turned with sudden hatred towards the Germans across the sea, those who for so long had pretended to be friends of the Swedish People, only to violate one of their most sacred institutions in the most bloody massacre to have ever occurred in the country..."

These are C. Brewer & Co., Theo H. Davies & Co., American Factors, Castle & Cooke and last but not least Alexander & Baldwin. These five corporations hail back to the Kingdom-era of the isles, but with the removal of tariffs and liberation of the economy they were able to come out on top.

Currently, these companies control over 90% of sugar-related business on the isles, including global shipping and transports. In 1930 Hawaii was responsible for a over 10% of the global sugar production (in excess of 1 million tonnes of sugar produced in Hawaii).

Even more interesting than the centralization of wealth is the nature of power in the hands of the executives of these companies. They enjoy mutual board positions in each others companies, not to mention their ties to Governor James Dole himself, personally and through the Hawaiian Pineapple Company.

Some thirty years ago, Attorney General of Hawaii Edmund Pearson Dole, referring to the Big Five, said:

The political situation in Turkey since the last election has been very dynamic. A large topic of discussion has been the recent moves by the joint CHP-DP during the Mobilization crisis to give more rights to regional councils to administrate healthcare and such, and the statements regarding an improvement in cultural cooperation between Kurds and Turks.

This caused the sharp rise in of a new party, Millet Partisi (Nation Party) to the forefront of the discussion. They gathered support from the more nationalist/conservative segments of both the CHP and DP. They seem to have significant popularity, especially in rural areas and the professional segment of the army.

The DP has been perceived as taking responsibility for the stability of the country, through Celâl Bayars speech of solidarity and unity alongside President İnönü, giving them a large boost in popularity. Additionally, his speeches about deregulation of trade with nations in both West and East has resonated with many Urban middle class citizens. The core demographic is in the more educated segments of society - teachers, engineers, doctors and businessmen.

The CHP however had taken a large blow due to how the international Crisis had panned out, with Turkey having to back down from Syria. However, it seems the core areas backing the party have solidified their alignment - Turks working within bureaucracy, agriculture and state industry.

When the country went out to vote, the result to follow was by no means clear.

* The DP (Yellow) is the largest party, garnering 45% of the vote, but not enough to form government singlehandedly. They will however be the first party given the task.

* The CHP (Red) has taken a large blow, falling 25 percentage points down to 34%, losing their previous position as majority party.

* The MP (Brown) had a surprisingly large turnout for their first election, garnering 17.6% of the votes, placing them as the third largest party.

* With different parties solidifying, the number of independent seats (Gray)  have dropped drastically, representing a mere 3%.

With no clear majority for any party, the DP will begin negotiations for forming a government, with President İnönü remaining during the transition."

Scania-Vabis and Volvo are truck manufacturers, also designing engines for various other types of vehicles such as cars and other unarmored military vehicles. Their vehicle factories are especially useful, as sections can be refitted to produce vehicles for other companies, such as AB Landsverk.


Bofors Nobelkrut AB is a combined military and civilian company, focusing on explosives for mining and blasting mountains, but they also have a thriving artillery division, supplying the Swedish navy with artillery for both naval and field deployment.

Landsverk AB is the only Swedish producer of armored vehicles, operating since the end of the Weltkrieg. Initially they only produced vehicles for the Swedish armed forces on license from Germany, but lately they have been developing their own designs. One of their current projects under development is the [Stridsvagn m/38 light tank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/38M_Toldi) based on the L60 tank that is currently being exported to neighbors such as Denmark, the [Stridsvagn m/41 Light Tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridsvagn_m/41), the [Landsverk L-62 Anti-Air vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsverk_L-62_Anti) and the [Pansarbil m/39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansarbil_m/39).


In the naval sector the shipyards in Sweden are plentiful, notable companies being AB Götaverken, Kockums Mekaniska Verkstads AB, Eriksbergs Mekaniska Verkstad AB as well as several other smaller shipyards and companies. These are responsible for designing the hulls, which are then outfitted with guns from Bofors and Electrics from Ericsson.

There are also a number of small arms producers such as Husqvarna AB, Ljungman Pump AB, Industri Svenska Automatvapen AB and Carl Gustafs stads gevärsfaktori. They are not as thriving as the other industries, relying heavily on licensed production, but they exist nonetheless."

Economically a Turkey wounded after the war of independence had taken long to recover, but unlike most European nations, the country was not ravaged during the world war. This leaves the country with an excellent opportunity to participate in the economic rebuilding of the continent and to swiftly improve living standards for its citizens.

At the beginning of the year there had been welfare cuts, which had led to many unemployed being strapped for funds, barely surviving. The idea was that these types of day labor would have a fixed payment rate per day. The Labor Office would take in payments and contracts for unskilled labour from employers and then hand these jobs out to whomever was unemployed and in need of work. The workers in turn received priority in queues to jobs, as well as an additional payment to their unemployment subsidies. The government would also provide their own jobs, including care of parks, minor maintenance and simple forms of community service when requests ran out. While the work might not be of any particular profit, it would be a good excuse to put people to work and pay them for it.

The hope with this was to stimulate growth via the labour provided, as well as encourage consumption by providing the unemployed with funds until they could get proper jobs."

The main change is an increase in military spending to 225 million Swedish Krona, roughly 1.5% of GDP and the equivalent of 56 million 1936 USD. There are however also several structural changes and investments.

The large winner here was the newly established airforce (Flygvapnet), almost tripling their budget from 15 to 42 million SEK. Large amounts of these sums would be directed towards the fledgling swedish aircraft industry, notably SAAB and ASJA. The would now have its peacetime organization extended by six flotillas of aircraft to a total of seven flotillas and one flight school. In addition to this the new organization would be extending its flying hours to 36'000 hours in warplanes and 14'000 hours with trainers.

The Navy would not see any major changes, merely a modernisation of the fleet by replacing older ships including two large destroyers and six submarines.

For the overarching organisation it was decided that a Supreme Commander should be appointed even in peacetime. In addition to this, certain structural changes were made in the field army.

Whilst the DP were only a few seats away from a singular majority, it was clear that any government formed would have to negotiate with the other parties.

Thus, it was that presidential candidate Celâl Bayar and DP party leader Mehmet Fuat Köprülü conducted negotiations with the other parties. The leader of the CHP and current president, İsmet İnönü, was however unenthusiastic about cooperating with his main rival, and the conservative-nationalist MP was the antithesis to the ideals of the DP. Having failed to gain interest from those two, Bayar was forced to take a different approach - negotiating with individual delegates.

Most independents had a relatively small number of points of interest, and after agreeing to certain concessions - particularly with regards to Kurdish culture. Ultimately, eighteen of the twenty-one independents in parliament could be convinced to support a DP government.

Whilst this had been going on, interest groups within the CHP had been approached to sound them out. Economy Minister Bekir Balta and a number of his key supporters were convinced to break with the party lines - but their conditions were steep. A continuation of the new statist policy for internal economy - in addition to the development of certain welfare policies.

At the beginning of June, almost a month after the election, the Bayar Presidency was put to a vote and confirmed by a majority of eight delegates in the assembly, becoming the third Turkish President. Not long after he was sworn in, and a cabinet was created. Notable members are ;Bekir Balta, remaining as minister of economy since the previous CHP government; Adnan Menderes, deputy prime minister. 

Lastly, deputy minister for culture Halide Edib Adıvar, entering parliament as an independent in the 1950's election and becoming the first woman in an upper-echelon government position. She has been tasked by her fellow independents with sounding out Kamuran Alî Bedirxan regarding the creation of an officially recognized adaptation of the Kurdish language within the Turkish latin alphabet."

This way, the strain on infrastructure will be smaller, and the work and expense that went into the mobilization will provide a benefit to the Turkish people and economy.

During the period that the men remain in service, one of the largest construction projects seen in Turkey will be performed. A decentralized infrastructure uplift.

Whilst there will be no ""final product"", the labor of half a million man-months aided by the machinery of the Turkish military cannot be understated. Coordinated by military engineers, the following will be done:

* Defensive structures on the Soviet and Yugoslav borders will be refurbished and slightly expanded.

* Key Rural roads will be widened and graveled.

* Local bridges are reinforced to support larger weights.

* Flat Gravel Runway strips will be made at key locations.

* Military doctors will hold basic lessons on First Aid in villages they travel through.

Notable areas of investment were into SJ (Statens Järnvägar), SSAB and LKAB to promote employment and increases in raw resource exports, as well as the Volvo and Scania automotive companies, to prevent a downturn. An agricultural mechanization subsidy would also be combined with this, in the hopes of stimulating growth. The approximate cost of this package would be 200m$.

However, the funds would have to come from somewhere. Much to the horror of Arbetarpartiet, the first options that were raised were the cutting of welfare funding and the raising of taxes for the working class. This would however only be enough to fund half of the proposed package, so the government would be looking into other ways to gain funds for the project."

Interestingly enough, it was Prime Minister Bagge that had raised the current proposal to parliament, and had it pass.

The idea was for Sweden to drop the Gold Standard and allow the central bank to print currency. This would release the government and economy from the shackles that Gold created, but also from the security. Sweden's relatively minor economy in the grand scheme of things would do little to help the fact. However, if the Nordic countries were to band together in a currency union backing this paper currency it would be granted far more inertia and trust on the financial market. A Scandinavian Krona, it was not a novel idea, as there had been a Scandinavian Currency Union until sometime during the twenties, but that had ruptured in the wake of the Great Depression in the US.

The added benefit of this being, of course, that with a single currency, it would be easier than ever to trade between the Nordic countries, it would be more stable than any individual paper currency that the nations could produce, and also allow for temporarily increased deficit spending to rise out of the wake of Black Monday, still affecting the lives of ordinary citizens almost a year later.

So, representatives of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Norway met with Danes in Copenhagen, seeking to secure their support for Scandinavian democracy. The Internationale ripped Norwegian democracy apart, and will not hesitate to do the same against Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Little could be done outside and the fires would always be burning. The Cerwyn lands were however in a unique position - less than a days travel from Winterfell and the hot springs that kept the Winter Town ever warm and welcoming.

Lord Caladog had assembled his populace at Cerwyn, making sure they were all gathered for the trek. Only a few would stay behind in every village, and some too in the Castle. He gave Idris a strong hug and a grin, ""Take care you big bear. You've taken good care of Cerwyn whilst we were off in the south, I'm sure you'll do so again now.""

Idris gave a small smile, ""Aye, Jeyne won't mind either, she was never fond of crowds, and now with Osric and Duncan off in the south we won't have to worry about them being lonely either.""

---

Maester Errol had said this day would be a calm one, good for making the trek to winter town without complications. He had been right - Caladog was riding alongside his little cousin Lynne at the head of the column. They were followed by the commoners. Horses, wagons, pedestrians, they were many. Children, women and elders had been given spots on top of sacks of grain and dried meat. A number of guards also made up the rear, to make sure none would fall behind and aid any wagons that encountered troubles.

At midday, they would pause for food and drink, but return to the journey northwards along the Kingsroad before too long. The day had been chilly, with the people wandering under the cover of furs, but he wanted them to arrive before the cold of night set in, so encouraged people to keep moving.

---

The sun had begun to set when the forwards outliers in the column reached the warmth of Winter Town. A few of the escorting knights had ridden ahead to bring word of their arrival. Caladog now turned around and rode back along the line and proceeded to follow the last stragglers into safety. Darkness had settled around them at this point, the chill making itself known even under cloth and pelt. Soon they'd all make themselves at home, joining in the evening gatherings around Winter Town. Caladog himself headed back into Winterfell, whence he had left the day before."

He was also aided in this decision by the [Finnish](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeltkriegPowers/comments/i4b9dz/event_stuck_in_the_middle_with_you/) and [Ukranians](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeltkriegPowers/comments/i49nsn/conflict_a_series_of_happenings/) doing the same.

Thus, the Swedish Embassy in D.C would receive a heavy task. They were to take contact with Scandinavian emigrants in the americas, whether that be in the first, second or third generation, and aid them. The main task would be to grant economic benefits to Scandinavian-Americans. These benefits would be to help communities to band together and prepare to weather the coming storm, but if interest was high enough, the Swedish government would also requisition ships to take people back across the Atlantic, back to Sweden and Scandinavia.

So, members at the embassy set out to complete their task, cooperating with the Danish, Norwegian, Finnish and German embassies as well as Scandinavian organizations in the US such as the Vasa Order of America.

The support resources made available for the task would amount to almost twenty million Swedish Krona.

In addition to this, aid personnel would be sent to the US to help in a potential evacuation aboard a Swedish ship that they travel over with. Almost 4’000 men with crates of supplies and funds to acquire trucks on american soil. >!A notable amount of the crates contain not supplies, but Swedish Mausers and M1918 BAR’s with ammunition, and the support personel are members of the Swedish Armed forces, capable of wielding those guns.!< 

The Swedes would travel into the Great Lakes using the St. Lawrence Seaway, and use lake Michigan to reach the Milwaukee harbour. Operations would largely be based from that ship, due to its relative proximity to Scandinavian ethnic regions. After they arrive in Milwaukee and acquire said trucks, they will make headway towards Minnesota, where large, contiguous communities of Scandinavians can be found. The trucks could then be used to take refugees back to the Ship if needed."

In Russian it had been challenged only by the Russian General Oil Corporation, owned by American [Standard Oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil) which had been split in two after an anti-trust suit in the US in 1912. A failed takeover attempt of Branobel by RGOC on the Berlin Stock Exchange lead to [Emanuel Nobel](https://www.foretagskallan.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/da-2015-000547-cfn010161-870x450.jpg) gaining a considerable amount of shares in his competitor as well as establishing control over several other European oil companies, including Volga-Baku Company, A.I. Mantashev & Co., the Anglo-Russian Maximov Oil Company in London and G.M. Lianozov Sons, of which he personally owned a third.

Apart from this, Branobel had also expanded into other areas, most notably a machine shop in St. Petersburg which was the first producer of diesel engines (for both trucks and ships) in the country and produced many other items such as gun carriages, shells (in cooperation with Swedish Nobelkrut AB), steam piping and train cars.

When Russia descended into civil war, the future of the company was most uncertain, Emanuel Nobel himself fled the country in 1918, but by a stroke of luck, the Weltkrieg ended with Germany victorious. They proceeded to intervene in the conflict, which prevented the Bolsheviks from reaching the Baku oil fields - the heart of Branobel operations, though they did maintain shares in other local oil companies across Siberia and Central Asia.

With the German sun rising and that of America and the UK waning, the world was wide open for Branobel. They would become the worlds largest producer of oil, supplying Mitteleuropa with fuel via lucrative contracts and setting up operations in newly acquired territories, their main competitor being the Royal Dutch Shell Group, Canada based British Petroleum and the remnants of Standard Oil, most notably Jersey Standard Oil (ESSO) and Standard Oil of New York (SOCONY).

After the Russian civil war, much of the country lay in ruins, the city of St. Petersburg however, along with the Branobel machine factory was relatively unharmed, thanks to Zinoviev surrendering the city to the whites. Branobel would restart their operations in the factory, and over time use it as a basis for further expansions in the country and diversification from the companies main focus of petrochem industry. While the Kolchak Putsch seemed a threat to the company at first, its German backing was a blessing, it meant that the company could continue its oil transports mostly unhindered, using the Caucasian railway, and oil tankers in the Black Sea.

Recently there has been talk of a joint automotive venture with the Korporatsiya Yusupova as a means to expanding production of trucks and cars in the country, though the future of this project is uncertain with the massive Black Monday Crisis rippling through the company and the ascension of Boris Savinkov to power in Moscow.

---

**Branobel** is still majority owned and managed by the Nobel family, who hold a controlling share in the company at roughly 60.8 percent of the shares and Baron Bilderling being the second largest shareholder.

It is, along with several other companies with ties to Alfred Nobel, the founder of the nobel price, part of the informal so-called Nobel Group. The company moved its headquarters to Stockholm at the start of the Russian Civil War, and after its end, they would come to remain there.

After the death of the former head of the company, Emanuel Ludvig Nobel in 1932 his shares passed on to his nephews after a fair share of controversy surrounding his will, since he himself only had daughters."

The Smithy is a room that gives divine inspiration to the smiths working within it to create masterworks inside that room (their inspiration fades if they leave). It also allows mortals to stay, work and focus indefinitely, so long as no one interrupts them, interruptions would also cause the inspiration for their current craft to fade. While crafting within the smithy, their mortal functions will be effectively halted and as long as they work in other words, they will not become more hungry, sleepy, thirsty or even age."

Hi folks!

You can call me Ice, I'm 18 and have been worldbuilding and RPing for a few years now. A little IRL, but mostly on dedicated subreddits. I have however never run a proper 1on1 roleplay, so I would like that.

The basic idea is that we'll find a genre, or established universe that we want to play in and around. I then create the world and story around your character with events, side characters and NPC's.

---

If you like that idea, here are a couple of things I need from you:

* Be creative and driven! Don't expect things to happen if you don't do anything.

* Collaboration

* Reasonable activity (at least once per day unless communicated otherwise)

* Reasonable effort (more than ""she looked out the window"" per reply), quality over quantity though.

* 3rd person, past tense

* If you want 18+ content I expect *you* to be 18+

---

Genres I like to write:

Fantasy, Sci-Fi (all the way from hard science to Sci-Fantasy), Cyberpunk, Historic, Alt-History (feel free to suggest others, as mentioned before, I am quite happy to *create* a universe if I can get some pointers as to what you want)

Established Universes I love:

Extended LOTR, ASOIAF, The Expanse, Mortal Engines, Kaiserreich, IRL

I know quite a few others not mentioned here, but one disclaimer, the universes I write are my own, so the canon are *guidelines*, not god.

Write a comment and ask, or DM me for more details!"

The Norwegian Syndicalists had acted against the constitution, and Haakon had considerable powers - even if he had seldom to exercise them before. The appointment of government, the dismissal of it, head of the armed forces, the church, the appointment of senior officials, veto of law, the list goes on. 

Only three decades earlier, almost eighty percent of his people had chosen that they would rather than not have a King, and the time had come for him to do his duty. The syndicalists that had bid him to follow the constitution at every turn, for the promise that they would do the same, had stabbed him and the country in the back, using violence to desecrate everything that was just a s honorable.

So, the King would use the powers that his people had given him, and as such, he made his announcement.

It would be prefaced by an introduction and a fanfare, after which Haakon made his speech.

However, Sweden had notable commercial interests in Russia with the Branobel Corporation, and with that had come a certain degree of understanding.

So it had come to be that the same subject had been broached with both the Finnish and Russian ambassadors to Stockholm, an end to the staring contest on the Fenno-Russian border to ensure a peaceful future. 

About a week later, both ambassadors had been invited to the ministers office, and found themselves sitting next to each other in the waiting room, and it was taking forever. Apparently, the Swedish minister was nowhere to be found, and they only had each other for company."

To the east, the clawlike structure descending from the mountains is furrows for a river, that would hopefully fill with water from the mountains. The little mountaintop next to it is a geyser from the exposed magma in the cave far beneath it. The cave entrances next to the water in the south are below water and accessible for... say, lobsters. The mountain range connects to the one in the tile southeast. The yellow-green southwestern area is a prarie-like expanse of grass, forests grow in the dark green areas to the east and grass extends south of the forest. The northwestern part is a sandy/arid plateau. The cavern entrances seem to beckon travelers and explorers to enter them and miners will always feel urged to delve *deeper*.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tJOU6fW.png) is a map of the underground cave system. In the top left corner is a color code for the map in descending altitude (top closest to the surface, bottom is lowest, each color code connects with the ones on the next to it and the level above and below), left part is traversable cave color and right is subterranean rivers. At the top is the color of entrances, (pink) and at the bottom is the color of the fourth cavern layer(puke green)/third river layer (really dark blue). I assume that tunnels that connect to the edge of the map can connect to caverns in other tiles. Unless otherwise mentioned, structures two levels away from each other do *not* connect and are impassable. Where rivers cross traversable caverns on the same level it is assumed to be a subterranean river crossing (small ones might be swimmable, those more than one pixel across definitely not).

Structures of note in the caverns:

* An underground waterfall in the topmost cavern in the first cavern layer (orange), here the river falls down into a chasm that is impassable, and continues eastward towards the big lvl 4 cavern with the exposed magma.

* A Chasm in the northeast somewhat north of the big cavern: A red (lvl 2) path meets a puke green (lvl 4) path here. The fourth level path is open above, and any poor flightless mortals who fall off the bottomless ledge/cliff in the lvl 2 path will end up here, presumably smashed to death.

* Underwater entrances to the big lvl 3 cavern in the south. Here the river flows out beneath water into the sea (those pink entrances indicated by the yellow arrow in the south). For some reason (fantastical) the sea doesn't flood the cavern. The big subterranean river is thus traversable for sea creatures all the way into the puke green cavern, it won't be easy though.

* The Magma Cavern: Deep underneath the surface (lvl 4) in the northeast is a massive cavern where the crust of the planet is exposed (marked by the purple spot in the cavern). A subterranean river cascades into this, creating enormous amounts of steam that rise up to the roof of the cavern and continues to the surface via a channel. The magma is so hot that it can melt any substance (fantastical), though it mortals seem to be capable of surviving relatively close to it for surprisingly long amounts of time.

* *Note*, this is most certainly not the full expanse of these caverns, as these larger ones are accompanied by many others, and there may be things that await those who dare delve *even deeper*. ;) [M] For those interested in using the caverns for stuff, give me a shout for further info!"

As the alarms sounded across Sweden, the Supreme Commander, Olof Thörnell, received word of an ongoing assault upon the Riksdag. For a moment, he sat silent, in shock, but soon, a look of determination spread across his face. He had been given this post to ensure the defence of Sweden in case of war, and that time was now. Sweden was under attack, and it was his duty to protect the people.

Even as the combat around the Riksdag came to an end, and the building was cleared, fighter aircraft were lifting off, warships were steaming out to sea, mobilization depots were dusted off and combat regiments were preparing to defend the country.

The Danish and Finnish high commands received the communique invoking their pact of defence. *'Sweden is under attack, prepare for mobilization.'*

When I was a kid I got a bunch of old comics from my grandparents (so probably published sometime when my dad was a kid, 70's/80's), many of which I have today. I brought two of my favourites with me on vacation and... lost them :( I don't know the name of one of them.

The comic book was probably published in Sweden at some point.

This comic is very similar in story and art style to four color comics version of Jules Vernes ""The Mysterious Island"" (issue 1213) (but it isn't that one). (It's not classic comics no. 34 either)

https://viewcomics.me/four-color-comics/issue-1213

Story is basically that this group of (I'm pretty sure) young adults (at least one is a woman) get stranded on this island (they may have gotten there on a balloon), start building up a home crusoe style. At one point they're making clay bricks. They encounter hostiles on the island. Later, a lake drains into a cavern which (as they explain it) causes the Island to explode, because it mixes with lava or something similar. They end up getting rescued from the last remaining rock jutting out of the ocean.

I distinctly remember two images from the book. One is a cliffside with a rope ladder (with wooden rungs) that they cut when some kind of unfriendly folks show up. The other is a whirlpool in a lake that ends up confusing them (the lake that drains into the volcano cavern).

Thanks in advance :)

With the war on Israel coming to an end and the results of the recent referendum in Palestine counted there was much cause for celebration in Jordan, and many reasons to look towards the future.

As such, King Abdullah was holding a press conference followed by a public event in Jerusalem. The entire thing would be broadcasted by radio and many newspapers were present to report.

The conference began with several Jordanian notables present. Among these were the King, Crown Prince Talal, the PM as well as several politicians such as the party leaders for the ABL, JCP, JSNP and PNP. Once the Press Conference came to a conclusion the event would continue outside.

---

The Public event was held at a stage set up outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque atop temple mount. As the aging King that had liberated Jordan from both Ottomans and Brits and Palestine from Israel the audience cheered. There was a slight whine from the microphone as he began to speak in Arabic.

The Al-Aqsa Mosque is a fitting venue to mark a new chapter for the Middle East. For six months, we have witnessed an extraordinary change take place in the Palestine. House by house, street by street; town by town; the people of Palestine have risen up to demand their basic human rights, and the Arab world heeded their call. We liberated those houses, those streets. We know that our own future is bound together by the forces of faith, culture and history.

Today, I would like to talk about this change – the forces that are driving it, and how we can respond in a way that advances our values and strengthens our security. Already, we have done much to shift our foreign policy following a decade defined by three major wars. The first against Israel secured our foothold there,  keeping the West Bank safe. In Syria, we tried to protect our Lebanese brethren from revolutionary forces, this still lies ahead of us. Now however, we have broken the Israelis momentum, and this Autumn we will begin to bring our people back home and continue transition to Jordanian lead. And after years of war against Israel, we have dealt a huge blow against them.

The IDF were no martyrs. They were mass murderers who offered a message of hate – an insistence that Jews had to take up arms against the Middle East, and that violence against men, women and children was the only path to change. He rejected democracy and individual rights for Muslims in favor of violent extremism, their agenda focused on what they could destroy – not what  can be built.

The Israelis and their murderous vision won some adherents. But even before their defeat, Israel was losing its struggle for relevance, as the overwhelming majority of people saw that the slaughter of innocents did not answer their cries for a better life. By the time we once more entered open conflict against them, the agenda of the World Zionist Organization had come to be seen by the vast majority of the region as a dead end, and the Arab people had taken their future into their own hands.
 fair election where he could choose his leader.

In the face of these challenges, Israel tried to direct their people's grievances elsewhere. We, the Arabs were blamed as the source of all ills. Antagonism toward us became the only acceptable outlet for political expression. Divisions of tribe, ethnicity and religious sect were manipulated as a means of holding on to power, or taking it away from somebody else.

But the events of the past six months show us that strategies of repression and diversion won't work anymore. A new generation has emerged. And their voices tell us that change cannot be denied. In Be'er Sheva, we heard the voice of the young mother who said, ""It's like I can finally breathe fresh air for the first time.""

In Jerusalem, we heard the students who chanted, ""The night must come to an end.""

In Jaffa we heard the engineer who said, ""Our words are free now. It's a feeling you can't explain.""

In Amman, we heard the young man who said, ""After the first yelling, the first shout, you feel dignity.""

Those shouts of human dignity are being heard across the Palestine. And through the moral force of freedom, we have achieved more change in six months than the Israelis have accomplished in a decade.

The question before us is what role Jorsan will play as this story unfolds. For decades, we have pursued a set of core interests in the region: countering colonialism and stopping the spread of Israel; securing the free flow of commerce, and safe-guarding the security of the region; standing up for the Liberty of Palestine.

We will continue to do these things, with the firm belief that Jordans interests are not hostile to peoples' hopes; they are essential to them.

Yet we must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind. 

So we face an historic opportunity. We have embraced the chance to show that Jordan values the dignity of the street vendor in Palestine more than the raw power of the Zionist refime. There must be no doubt that Jordan welcomes change that advances self-determination and opportunity. Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise. But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be.

We support a set of universal rights. Those rights include free speech; the freedom of peaceful assembly; equality for all men under the rule of law; and the right to choose your own representatives – whether you live in Baghdad or Jerusalem; Cairo or Amman.

And finally, we support political and economic reform in the Middle East and North Africa that can meet the legitimate aspirations of ordinary people throughout the region.

Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest– today I am making it clear that it is a top priority that must be translated into concrete actions, and supported by all of the diplomatic, economic and strategic tools at our disposal.

Let me be specific. First, it will be the policy of the Jordan to promote reform across the region, and to support transitions towards Arab Unity.

That effort begins in the Arab Peninsula, where the stakes are high –as we were at the vanguard of this democratic wave, and Iraq is both a longstanding partner. Both nations can set a strong example through free and fair elections; a vibrant civil society; accountable and effective institutions; moves towards Arab Unity and responsible regional leadership. But our support must also extend to nations where transitions have yet to take place.

Tolerance is particularly important when it comes to religion. Here in Jerusalem, only a.month ago, we heard Jordanians from all walks of life chant, ""Arabs, we are one""

Prosperity also requires tearing down walls that stand in the way of progress – borders that stop commerce; hithe red tape that stops an idea from becoming a business; the patronage that distributes wealth based on tribe or sect. We will help governments meet international obligations, and invest efforts anti-corruption; by working with parliamentarians who are developing reforms, and activists who use technology to hold government accountable.

Let me conclude by talking about another cornerstone of our approach to the region, and that relates to the pursuit of peace.

For the Jordanian people, the scenes of war and upheaval in the Palestine and Israel may be unsettling, but the forces driving it are not unfamiliar. Our own nation was founded through a rebellion against an empire. Our people fought a painful civil war that extended freedom and dignity to those who were enslaved. And I would not be standing here today unless past generations turned to the morality as a way to perfect our nation – organizing, marching, and working together to make real those words that declared our nation: ""We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal.""

Those words must guide our response to the change that is transforming our Arab world – words which tell us that repression will fail, that tyrants will fall, and that every man is endowed with certain inalienable rights. It will not be easy. There is no straight line to progress, and hardship always accompanies a season of hope and unity. Now, we cannot hesitate to stand squarely on the side of those who are reaching for their rights, knowing that their success will bring about a world that is more peaceful, more stable, and more just."

To this end, we have asked the Crown Colony in Cyprus - which is aspiring to become a fully fledged democratic nation - to host a grand conference on the matter. They responded favorably and thus the conference will take place in Nicosia. Due to the sensitive nature of the topic, we have decided to invite all the great powers of the world so that the discussion mirrors that of global interests in addition to the Black Sea nations, to represent local interests.

The nations invited are Turkey, the USSR, the USA, the UK, France, Romania, Bulgaria and last but not least the Republic of China. The conference is intended to begin in May.

The topics for discussion are as follows:

- Revision of the existing Turko-Soviet Varna Agreement

- A new legal basis for the convention on the straits, Turkish Law

- Changes to regulations desired by the Black Sea nations

- Changes to regulations desired by the other Great Powers

Attendees would of course be free to propose new or altered topics of conversation upon the initiation of discussions."

The paper fluttered in the wind as a bulldozer slowly closed one of the three mass graves that had been dug across Sweden. ""The day democracy almost died"" was what it would be remembered as, not the ""Sunday Massacre"", which would've been a more apt name.

Power had been cut in all three of Swedens largest cities in the morning, and the Motala Signal Station had been broadcasting a pre-recorded message to the radios of the country. 

Notable effects in the aftershocks of the event had been the banning of all radical left parties, with the Social Democrats being the only remaining party on the left wing. Any seats that would have been given to them in parliament were instead distributed to high ranking military officials. In addition to this, the powers of both the military and the State Police (national security agency) were expanded."

What is to become of the West Bank and Palestine when the entire region has been liberated? 

With the blessing of King Abdullah and Allah the parliament has begun to draft a referendum to be held once the war comes to an end.

A majority of the Arab Palestinian populace fled to the West Bank and are now all Jordanian citizens.

1. Jordan United: This first option means that the Palestinians have decided that they wish to remain Jordanian citizens, in Jordan and would support the incorporation of the rest of Palestine into Jordan.

2. Federation of Transjordan and Palestine: The territories of Transjordan and Palestine would each become a part of a Levant Federation, headed by King Abdullah. Each substate would keep the overall constitution with the upper house of parliament being joint for both. Each substate would have their own proportionally elected lower house though which would have jurisdiction on local issues.

3. Independent Palestinian Hashemite Monarchy: This option would mean the founding of a separate Palestinian state under the rulership of Prince Nayef bin Abdullah, preliminarily using the Jordanian constitution as a guideline for state structure until such a time that they can decide on their own. In the event that this option is chosen, King Abdullah has pledged that he and the rest of Jordan will assist the foundation of the new state, providing defence and public services until the new state can take over wholly.

4. Independent Palestinian Republic: The last option in the referendum. It would mean that the Palestinians found their own state as a republic. Preliminarily, the current MP's that currently represent the West Bank in the Jordanian Parliament would found the Palestinian Parliament and decide upon a constitution. In the event that this option is chosen, King Abdullah has pledged that he and the rest of Jordan will assist the foundation of the new state, providing defence and public services until the new state can take over wholly.

While it is obvious which option King Abdullah would prefer, he feels that it is important that his population makes this choice on their own, much in the same way that they proclaimed him their King six years ago.

The Constitutional Party, which is the party most friendly to the Monarchy support the first option in the referendum currently. The Arab Brotherhood League campaign for the first two, as they believe in the unity of the Arab people as a whole. The Jordanian Socialist Nationalist Party would prefer the second option, as they have seen the strain that the West Bank recovery initiative has put on the Jordanian economy, and feel that separating the budgets would be beneficial for the people upon the east bank, from where a majority of their voters come. The Palestinian Nationalist Party would like to see option 4 as they see this as complete independence from Jordanian authority, though rumor has it that some in their number would be willing to have a monarchy too. Last but not least is the Amman Communist Party, ACP. They have vowed to convince their voters to boycott the referendum, as they wish for a complete abolition of Jordanian Monarchy, but keep the east and west banks united, and this is not an option in the referendum.

Overall, the outlook on results to this referendum is mixed and it is likely hard to make a final prediction on the outcome."

In a somewhat upsetting move, Prince Gustav Adolf, the grandson of the King had been appointed minister of defence. He was also a senior officer within the Swedish army. In addition to this came several new ministers.

One of the first tasks the new government had received was to adress the shortage of food amongst the unemployed, and methods to swiftly bring the economy back to its feet. The feeling was that progress was far too slow, and Sweden would need to be strong in order to deter hostile action in an ever more tense world, especially noting the recent developments in Belgium."

Notably investments in infrastructure, mining and raw resource companies, support funds to the automotive industry in addition to an agricultural mechanization fund causing demand for tractors and similar equipment. There was also a subsidy on resource exports.

Soon after an agreement was struck with [Ukraine](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeltkriegPowers/comments/hxb65m/diplomacy_representatives_from_ssab_in_ukraine) to exchange bread and steel at pre-crash prices. The bread would be sold at a deficit on the Swedish market, and with the help of the resource subsidies a profit could be made on the steel to ensure continued production in the Swedish steel industry.

In may, there was a [conference with the other nordic nations](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeltkriegPowers/comments/hxltuf/diplomacy_nordic_conferece_on_black_monday/), which culminated in the Treaty of Stockholm, establishing a free trade bubble in Scandinavia with minor tariffs against mitteleuropa on goods produced within the trade zone. This would lead to minor tariffs in retaliation, though both the Swedish and German governments have agreed that the tariffs will be ended once they have recovered from Black Monday.

Later yet, the conservative government pushed through an [increase in defence spending](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeltkriegPowers/comments/hy4t3r/event_f%C3%B6rsvarsbeslutet_1936) , meaning more soldiers employed and more military equipment requested from the Swedish arms industry, including a newborn aeroplane sector. They would use Swedish materials and thus stimulate the economy. 

Lastly, after the chaotic election the new cabinet pushed through a [reform to the labour office](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeltkriegPowers/comments/i2bvi2/event_arbetsf%C3%B6rmedlingen_work_for_the_people/) in hopes of stimulating the economy and alleviating some effects of the welfare cuts earlier that year.

The CEO of the Swedish airline ABA (Aerotransport AB) were considering that cooperation amongst the airlines of the Nordic Nations would both increase efficiency, and allow for larger financial undertakings.

As such, they approached Det Norske Luftfartselskap A/S (The Norwegian Aviation Company) and Det Danske Luftfartselskab A/S (Danish Air Lines) with a proposal.
